## 🧠 Abstract

Quantum Field Dynamics (QFD) is a first-principles field theory that derives spacetime, particles, forces, and physical constants from a single multivector field ψ defined over a 6D phase space with signature (3,3). The theory is written entirely in Geometric Algebra (Cl(3,3)) and governed by a single dimensionless Lagrangian L_6D. Time, mass, charge, gravity, and quantum mechanics all emerge from its intrinsic structure, without invoking singularities, force bosons, or spacetime curvature. This whitepaper provides a compact overview of the theory's core components, predictions, and research roadmap.

## 🔑 Core Concepts

- **Field Definition:**  
  ψ(X, τ) is a multivector-valued field over 6D phase space (3 position + 3 momentum dimensions).  
  The evolution parameter τ replaces coordinate time.

- **Mathematical Framework:**  
  Cl(3,3) Geometric Algebra enables natural handling of scalars, vectors, bivectors, and spinors without complex numbers.

- **Core Lagrangian (dimensionless):**  
  L_6D = L_kin + L_rotor + L_charge + L_EM + L_pot + L_dilation  
  All known dynamics arise from this form.

- **Emergence of Time:**  
  Time is not a dimension but a scalar ordering parameter derived from the field's Hamiltonian evolution.

| Phenomenon           | QFD Derivation                                |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Dirac Equation       | Emerges from ψ projection to 4D with rotor phase |
| Maxwell's Equations  | From vector projection of ψ’s field equation  |
| g-factor             | g = 2 from rotor torque, g–2 from geometry    |
| Charge Quantization  | Topological winding in scalar ansatz          |
| Gravity              | Emergent time dilation from ψ_s(x) structure  |
| Redshift             | Cumulative loss via photon-photon scattering  |
| CMB + LSS            | From equilibrium ψ_s power spectrum P_ψ(k)    |
| SN1a Dimming         | From flux-dependent redshift, no acceleration |
| Neutrino Oscillations| Rotor phase precession among ψ isomers        |
| Nuclear Binding      | Electron-nucleus field cancellation—no gluons |

## 📐 Constants from Calibration

All dimensionful constants (ħ, G, e, c) are emergent from dimensionless wavelet solutions calibrated against known observables.

- Use Self-Consistent Field (SCF) solver to find ψ wavelets
- Match to observed electron properties
- Use χ² minimization to fix {E₀, L₀, λ_i, V_n, k_J}
- Predict all other masses, charges, and coupling strengths

## 🔬 Falsifiable Predictions

- Redshift curve: exponential decay with flux loss
- Photon-photon scattering at measurable cross-section
- g−2 anomaly calculated from wavelet geometry
- No Big Bang signature; CMB arises from ψ equilibrium
- BAO peak from ψ harmonic length, not early plasma
- Neutrino mass hierarchy from rotor eigenvalue splitting

## 📈 Research Roadmap

- ✅ Formal derivations complete (Book + Appendices A–N)
- 🧩 Build SCF solver (numerical)
- 🧪 Compare to (g–2), redshift, CMB, LSS, decay data
- 🔭 Search for “zombie galaxies” via weak lensing
- 📊 Publish open datasets and solver results
