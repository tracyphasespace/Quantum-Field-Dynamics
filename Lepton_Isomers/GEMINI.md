# Gemini Workspace

This file tracks the status and rules for the interactive development session.

## Status

*   Initial project review complete.
*   Awaiting next user command.

## Rules

1.  **Shell:** All shell commands will be executed using Windows PowerShell.
2.  **File Modifications:** To maintain project integrity, existing files will not be modified. New files will be created for testing and experimentation. For example, instead of modifying `original_script.py`, create `test_script.py`.
