# QFD Phoenix: Proposed Three-Objective Paradigm

## Theoretical Framework Implementation

This document summarizes the **proposed three-objective paradigm** implemented in QFD Phoenix, exploring the theoretical possibility of treating electron/muon/tau as **isomers** (different energy states) of a single unified field equation rather than separate particles.

---

## The Three-Objective Paradigm

### **Objective 1: Universal Calibration from Electron**
Lock all physics parameters using **only** the electron ground state:
- **Phoenix Core Hamiltonian**: `H = ∫ [ ½(|∇ψ_s|² + |∇ψ_b|²) + V₂·ρ + V₄·ρ² - ½·k_csr·ρ_q² ] dV`
- **Parameters calibrated**: V₂, V₄, g_c, k_csr from electron mass (511 keV) and g-2 anomaly
- **Current status**: ~9.5% precision on electron g-2 predictions (observed in canonical implementation)

### **Objective 2: Excited State Isomer Search**
Find muon and tau as **excited states** of the same field equation:
- **Muon target**: First excited state at ~105.7 MeV
- **Tau target**: Second excited state at ~1.777 GeV  
- **Method**: Deflation/orthogonal search with electron-calibrated parameters
- **Hypothesis**: Different angular momentum → different stability → may explain lepton lifetimes

### **Objective 3: Unified g-2 Predictions** 
Predict all lepton g-2 values from field-fundamental Zeeman experiments:
- **QFD Zeeman splitting**: Direct magnetic field coupling through Phoenix Hamiltonian
- **Alternative to perturbative QED**: Exact field evolution with magnetic interactions
- **Theoretical capability**: Potential for tau g-2 prediction (currently unmeasured experimentally)
