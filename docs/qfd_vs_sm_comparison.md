## Reading Guide

- **SM wins**: Standard Model has a clear, quantitative, experimentally verified account.
- **QFD wins**: QFD provides a derivation or explanation that SM does not.
- **Comparable**: Both frameworks have quantitative accounts (possibly different quality).
- **Neither**: Neither framework fully explains the phenomenon.
- **QFD gap**: QFD has no account; SM does.
- **SM gap**: SM has no account; QFD does.

### Interpretation

The Standard Model dominates in particle physics (DIS, jets, electroweak) and cosmology (BBN, dark matter, CMB precision). QFD's strengths are in foundational derivations (constants from alpha, spacetime from algebra, QM from geometry) and nuclear physics (zero-parameter predictions). The frameworks are complementary more than competing: QFD addresses "why" questions that SM leaves unanswered, while SM has far more quantitative predictive power across particle physics.

### Honest Bottom Line

**SM is the established, experimentally validated framework with thousands of confirmed predictions.** QFD is a candidate extension/reinterpretation that derives some SM inputs from geometry but lacks quantitative treatments of the strong interaction, electroweak physics, and several cosmological observations. QFD should be evaluated as a research program, not as a replacement for SM.
