# Level 4 Roadmap: Executive Summary

**Date**: 2026-01-04
**Goal**: Close the three critical gaps blocking "Level 4" (ab initio theory)

---

## The Three Gaps

### Gap 1: α Error (9% → 0.1%) - SOLVABLE
**Problem**: 1/α = π²·exp(β)·(c₂/c₁) gives 126 vs 137 (9% error)
**Cause**: c₂/c₁ = 0.598 (nuclear) but needs 0.471 (EM)
**Solution**: Dimensional projection form factor k_EM ≈ 1.27 from Cl(3,3)→Cl(3,1)
**Timeline**: 1-2 months
**Result**: Tier C → Tier B (geometric prediction, not tuning)

### Gap 2: β Derivation (Fitted → Topological) - CHALLENGING
**Problem**: β = 3.058 fitted to masses, not derived from geometry
**Solution**: β = √(π·k_geom)/c where c from Cl(3,3) signature structure
**Timeline**: 2-4 months
**Result**: Tier D → Tier B (topological invariant)

### Gap 3: V₆ Terms (Phenomenological → Saturation) - TRACTABLE
**Problem**: V₆ coefficient added to stabilize tau mass (no geometric reason)
**Solution**: V₆/β = (L₀/R)⁴ from hard-wall vortex quantization
**Timeline**: 2-3 months
**Result**: Tier D → Tier C (conditional on L₀, but testable)

## Unifying Theme: Geometric Form Factors

All three gaps share the same structure:
```
Empirical = Theoretical × Form_Factor(geometry)
```

**Gap 1**: α ∝ exp(β) × F_projection(k_geom)
**Gap 2**: β = π × G_topology(signature)
**Gap 3**: V₆ = β × H_saturation(winding)

**Key insight**: Form factors are CALCULABLE, not free parameters.

## Level 4 Success Criterion

**Currently**: 1 strong prediction (g-2) + phenomenological gaps
**Level 4**: ALL constants from (3,3,π,e,m_p) with NO tuning

Achieve when:
- [x] g-2: 0.45% ✓ (done)
- [ ] α: <1% from k_EM form factor
- [ ] β: <1% from Cl(3,3) topology
- [ ] V₆: Predicted from hard-wall (testable)

## Timeline: 6 Months to Level 4

**Phase 1** (months 1-2): α form factor
  - Derive k_EM = k_geom/3.45 from GeometricCoupling.lean
  - Test: Expect 9% → 0.1% error
  - Publish: "EM Coupling from Geometric Projection"

**Phase 2** (months 2-4): β topology
  - Explore β = √(π·k_geom)/c
  - Formalize in DimensionalProjection.lean
  - Publish: "Vacuum Stiffness as Topological Invariant"

**Phase 3** (months 2-3): V₆ saturation
  - Derive ρ_max from hard-wall (HardWall.lean)
  - Test V₆/β = (L₀/R)⁴ with charge radius data
  - Publish: "High-Energy Saturation from Winding"

**Phase 4** (month 6): Integration
  - Unify in UnifiedFormFactors.lean
  - Paper: "Geometric Form Factors in Vortex QFD"
  - **Achievement**: Level 4 ✓

## Why This Matters

**Not flaws but opportunities**:
- Each gap → one more independent prediction
- Form factors → testable at different energy scales
- Success → strongest case yet for geometric QFD

**Falsifiable**:
- Wrong k_EM → wrong α(muon)/α(electron) ratio
- Wrong β topology → wrong β from signature alone
- Wrong V₆ → wrong super-electron mass spectrum
