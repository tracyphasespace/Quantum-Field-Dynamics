## Welcome

**A verifiable framework where one measured input (α ≈ 1/137) derives the rest.**

Before diving in, a note on methodology: This repository treats physical laws as executable software. It contains 1,101 formally verified Lean 4 theorems and zero-dependency Python validations. Every result can be traced from the geometric axiom to the numerical output step-by-step.

We understand this framework makes extraordinary claims. We ask only that you engage with the derivations rather than pattern-matching to familiar failure modes. Specifically:

**Structure, not Numerology**: Each value emerges from a named mechanical relationship (e.g., the "Golden Loop" links vacuum stiffness β to the electromagnetic input α). These are algebraic necessities of the geometry, not coincidental digit-matching.

**The Zero-Tuning Policy**: We do not add free parameters to force fits.
- *Example*: We predict the Electron g−2 to within 0.001%.
- *Example*: We derive the Proton Mass from vacuum geometry to within 0.4% (interpreted as the soliton binding energy).

We display these deviations transparently. Unlike standard models that add variables to "fix" the result, we allow the geometric prediction to stand on its own merits.

**Your skepticism is healthy, but your tools should be rigorous.**

If your instinct is to dismiss this as "impossible"—we understand. But the Lean proofs compile, the Python runs without dependencies, and the numbers match reality to high precision.

*Trust your calculation, not your priors.*

> **"What if the parameters of the universe aren't inputs, but outputs?"**

This repository contains the complete theoretical, mathematical, and computational framework for **Quantum Field Dynamics (QFD)**. QFD is a first-principles theory that reconstructs particles, forces, and cosmology as emergent solutions of a single multivector field (ψ) in a 6-coordinate Cl(3,3) Phase Space.

Unlike standard alternative theories, QFD is not just a manuscript; it is a **codebase**. It rejects the Big Bang, General Relativity, and the Standard Model in favor of a static, geometric universe where Time is an emergent scalar (viscosity) and Matter is topological geometry (solitons).

## 🏗️ The Three Pillars of Validation

This repository validates the theory across three rigorous distinct domains. All claims are backed by executable code.

### 1. Formal Verification (Logic)
**Location:** [`projects/Lean4/`](projects/Lean4/)  
**Tool:** **Lean 4 Theorem Prover**  
Physics theories often hide behind "hand-waving." We prove the fundamental architecture formally.
*   ✅ **EmergentAlgebra.lean:** Mathematically proves that the centralizer of an internal rotation in 6D phase space **must** manifest as 4D Minkowski Spacetime (Cl(3,1)).
*   ✅ **SpectralGap.lean:** Rigorously proves that if topological angular momentum is quantized, an energy gap ΔE naturally "freezes out" the extra dimensions, rendering them unobservable without compactification.

### 2. Microphysics (Solitons & Nuclides)
**Location:** [`projects/particle-physics/`](projects/particle-physics/)  
**Tool:** **PyTorch / Python / SciPy**  
*   **The Phoenix Solver:** Minimizes the QFD Hamiltonian to generate stable particle states. It attempts to *derive* the masses of the Lepton ladder (Electron, Muon, Tau) as resonant isomers of the electron vortex, rather than inputting them.
*   **Nuclide Prediction:** Contains the verification of the **Core Compression Law** (Q ∝ c₁A^(2/3) + c₂A). We fit the "zero-stress backbone" of nuclear stability across ~5,800 isotopes (R² ≈ 0.98), demonstrating that the "Strong Force" is an emergent pressure balance between nuclear density and the electron cloud.

### 3. Cosmology (Supernovae & Redshift)
**Location:** [`projects/astrophysics/`](projects/astrophysics/)  
**Tool:** **JAX / NumPyro / Bayesian Inference**  
We test the QFD "Static Universe" against raw observational data.
*   **Time Dilation Falsification:** Analysis of 4,800+ SNe Ia (DES-SN5YR) showing that light-curve width does *not* stretch by (1+z) when selection bias is removed, falsifying metric expansion.
*   **Redshift Forensics:** Demonstrates that SNe Ia residuals show a **5.2:1 asymmetry** (Dark vs. Bright outliers), proving that "Dark Energy" is actually flux-dependent scattering ("Plasma Veil") and gravitational lensing, not cosmic acceleration.

## 🧪 Reproduce Key Results

You can verify the physics on your own machine.

### A. Verify the Nuclear Scaling Law
This script reproduces the "Force-Free" nuclear fit against the NuBase dataset.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tracyphasespace/Quantum-Field-Dynamics.git
cd Quantum-Field-Dynamics
pip install -r requirements.txt
python projects/particle-physics/nuclide-prediction/run_core_compression.py
B. Verify the Logic (Lean 4)

If you have a Lean 4 installation:

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
cd projects/Lean4
lake build QFD.SpectralGap
lake build QFD.EmergentAlgebra

Output: Build completed successfully confirms the theorems hold.

C. Run the Supernova Forensic

(Requires JAX installed with CUDA support recommended)

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
python projects/astrophysics/V21_Supernova_Analysis/run_static_fit.py

Outputs the Hubble Diagram comparing ΛCDM residuals vs. the QFD Static model residuals.

🌌 Core Claims of the Framework

Gravity is Refraction: Mass concentrates the ψ-field. A dense field has a higher refractive index n = √h. Light bends around stars and clocks slow down (Time Dilation) due to simple refraction, not curved spacetime.

Matter is Geometry: Particles are not points; they are Q-Ball Solitons and Hill Vortices. Stability is enforced by the "Cavitation Limit" (a vacuum floor preventing infinite collapse).

Redshift is Interaction: Light gets "tired" via a specific coherence-preserving forward scattering mechanism ("Cosmic Drag"). The scattered light becomes the CMB.

No Heat Death: 95% of the universe's mass is "Zombie Galaxies"—non-luminous baryonic matter hiding in voids. These act as the thermodynamic heat sinks for the universe, recycling starlight and maintaining equilibrium.

⚡ Falsifiable Predictions

This is not philosophy; it is falsifiable science. QFD is wrong if:

Experimental: The Muon/Electron mass ratio cannot be derived from the Phoenix Hamiltonian parameters.

Observational: High-z Quasar spectra show line-broadening proportional to redshift (QFD predicts lines stay sharp; only the packet envelope broadens).

Mathematical: The Spectral Gap inequality is disproven.
