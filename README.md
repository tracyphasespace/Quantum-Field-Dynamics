# Quantum Field Dynamics (QFD)
New View on an Old Universe

**A Unified Theory from First Principles**  
Author: Tracy McSheery

This repository contains the theoretical, computational, and conceptual foundation for *Quantum Field Dynamics (QFD)*, a framework for physics that reconstructs spacetime, quantum mechanics, electromagnetism, gravity, and particle structure from a single geometric field \(\psi\) defined over the Clifford Algebra \(\text{Cl}(3,3)\).

## ðŸŒŒ Core Claims

- Time is emergent: a scalar ordering parameter \(\tau\), not a spacetime coordinate.
- Gravity arises from field-induced time dilation, not curvature.
- Redshift is caused by Ïˆ-mediated photon scattering, not cosmic expansion.
- Charge is a topological winding number.
- All particles are stable solitonic wavelets of Ïˆ.
- No need for inflation, dark matter, dark energy, or strong/weak bosons.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

- `docs/`: Theory papers, technical reviews, derivations.
- `solver/`: Code for wavelet solvers and calibration.
- `examples/`: Wavelet configs and outputs.
- `results/`: Plots and figures from simulations.
- `tests/`: Unit tests for solver components.

## ðŸš€ Getting Involved

Coming soon:  
- An open call for contributors to help build the Grand Unified Solver (GPU-enabled SCF code).
- Initial targets: Wâ‚‘, gâˆ’2, neutrino oscillations, photon redshift.
- See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines (to be created).
