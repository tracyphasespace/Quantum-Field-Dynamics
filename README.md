# Quantum Field Dynamics (QFD)
New View on an Old Universe

Each of the 'contrarian' views is explained with no math, just logic.

This repository contains the theoretical, computational, and conceptual foundation for *Quantum Field Dynamics (QFD)*, a framework for physics that reconstructs spacetime, quantum mechanics, electromagnetism, gravity, and particle structure from a single geometric field Psi defined over the Clifford Algebra Cl(3,3).

##  Core Claims

- Time is emergent: a scalar ordering parameter Tau, not a spacetime coordinate.
- Gravity arises from field-induced time dilation, not curvature.
- Redshift is caused by ψ-mediated photon scattering, not cosmic expansion.
- Charge is a topological winding number.
- All particles are stable solitonic wavelets of ψ.
- No need for inflation, dark matter, dark energy, or strong/weak bosons.

##  Repository Structure

- `docs/`: Theory papers, technical reviews, derivations.
- `solver/`: Code for wavelet solvers and calibration.
- `examples/`: Wavelet configs and outputs.
- `results/`: Plots and figures from simulations.
- `tests/`: Unit tests for solver components.

##  Getting Involved
> “The foundational phase of QFD—defining the ψ-field, constructing the Lagrangian, and deriving the geometric basis for quantum gravity, charge, redshift, and wavelet-based matter—has been completed largely in solitude.  
>  
> This represents ~80% of the core theoretical effort.  
>  
> The remaining 20%—numeric calibration, projection refinement, and computational modeling—lies squarely in the domain of distributed scientific expertise.  
>  
> This is your invitation to help complete the picture.”

🔧 **Help us build:**
- The **Grand Unified Solver** – a GPU-enabled SCF field engine for stable ψ wavelets
- Numerical evaluations of constants: \( g−2 \), \( \alpha \), neutrino oscillation spectra, etc.
- Experimental tests of QFD’s predictions for redshift, charge, and mass spectra
