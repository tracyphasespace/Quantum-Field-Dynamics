# Quantum Field Dynamics (QFD)
New View on an Old Universe

**A Unified Theory from First Principles**  
Author: Tracy McSheery

This repository contains the theoretical, computational, and conceptual foundation for *Quantum Field Dynamics (QFD)*, a framework for physics that reconstructs spacetime, quantum mechanics, electromagnetism, gravity, and particle structure from a single geometric field \(\psi\) defined over the Clifford Algebra \(\text{Cl}(3,3)\).

##  Core Claims

- Time is emergent: a scalar ordering parameter \(\tau\), not a spacetime coordinate.
- Gravity arises from field-induced time dilation, not curvature.
- Redshift is caused by ψ-mediated photon scattering, not cosmic expansion.
- Charge is a topological winding number.
- All particles are stable solitonic wavelets of ψ.
- No need for inflation, dark matter, dark energy, or strong/weak bosons.

##  Repository Structure

- `docs/`: Theory papers, technical reviews, derivations.
- `solver/`: Code for wavelet solvers and calibration.
- `examples/`: Wavelet configs and outputs.
- `results/`: Plots and figures from simulations.
- `tests/`: Unit tests for solver components.

##  Getting Involved
The foundational phase of Quantum Field Dynamics—defining the ψ-field formalism, constructing the Lagrangian, and deriving the geometric basis for gravity, quantum behavior, and cosmology—has been completed largely in solitude. This represents approximately 80% of the total theoretical effort. The remaining 20%—comprising numerical calibration, formal projection refinements, and computational modeling—falls naturally into the domain of distributed scientific expertise and computational infrastructure. This is precisely where the broader physics and mathematics community can, and should, take over.

Coming soon:  
- An open call for contributors to help build the Grand Unified Solver (GPU-enabled SCF code).
- Initial targets: Wₑ, g−2, neutrino oscillations, photon redshift.
- See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines (to be created).
