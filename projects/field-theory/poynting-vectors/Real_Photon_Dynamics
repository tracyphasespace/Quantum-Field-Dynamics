A Scleronomic, Real-Valued Representation of Photon Dynamics in Cl(3,3) as a Complement to Work on the Wigner Little Group
A complementary mathematical framework extends this physical intuition from the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07909 The “Wigner Little Group for Photons Is a Projective Subalgebra” by Moab Croft, Hamish Todd, Edward Corbett.
This method uses the real Geometric Algebra Cl(3,3) on a 6-coordinate phase space to represent photon dynamics. The primary advantage of this approach is its ability to describe wave phenomena using entirely real-valued geometric objects, eliminating the need for the abstract imaginary unit i and an explicit time coordinate.
1. The Mathematical Arena: Cl(3,3) Phase Space
Instead of the conventional 4D Spacetime Algebra (Cl(1,3)), this framework is built upon a 6-coordinate phase space (x, y, z, p_x, p_y, p_z). The algebra of this space, Cl(3,3), is generated by six orthonormal basis vectors:
Spatial Basis {e₁, e₂, e₃}: Corresponding to the (x, y, z) directions, with the standard Euclidean metric eᵢ² = +1.
Momentum Basis {f₁, f₂, f₃}: Corresponding to the momentum directions (p_x, p_y, p_z), with a non-Euclidean metric defined by fᵢ² = -1.
The choice fᵢ² = -1 is the foundational postulate that allows the algebra to naturally produce wave-like dynamics from real-valued components.
2. A Scleronomic, Real-Valued Photon Representation
This framework allows us to reconstruct the photon's wave function without complex numbers or an explicit time variable.
2.1. Geometric Origin of Phase
The oscillatory behavior of a wave, typically represented by exp[iθ], relies on the algebraic property i² = -1. In Cl(3,3), this property is naturally held by bivectors representing planes of rotation. For instance, a bivector for the momentum-space plane p_x-p_y is B = f₁f₂, which squares to:
B² = (f₁f₂)² = f₁f₂f₁f₂ = -f₁²f₂² = -(-1)(-1) = -1
Thus, the abstract i can be replaced by a real, physical bivector B that represents a plane of rotation.
2.2. A Time-Independent ("Scleronomic") Phase
To create a static representation, the wave's phase θ is re-parameterized from a function of (x,t) to a function of the 6C phase-space coordinate X = (x, p). Time evolution is mapped onto translation along a chosen momentum axis, p_L (longitudinal momentum).
Standard Phase: θ(x, t) = k·x - ωt
Phase-Space Phase: θ(X) = k·x - ω'p_L
The assembled real-valued wave solution is then a static multivector field configuration in phase space:
F(X) = A · exp[B(k·x - ω'p_L)] = A · [cos(θ(X)) + B·sin(θ(X))]
Here, the wave's oscillation is a real geometric rotation in the plane B, and its "evolution" corresponds to movement through the coordinates of phase space.
3. The Physical Poynting Vector and Intuitive Wave Progression
This real-valued, geometric representation provides a profoundly intuitive picture of the photon's physical dynamics.
3.1. The Geometric Poynting Vector
The flow of electromagnetic energy, described by the Poynting vector S, is traditionally given by the vector cross product S = (1/μ₀) · (E × B). While functional, the cross product is an algebraic shortcut specific to three dimensions with limited geometric meaning.
In this Geometric Algebra framework, the Poynting vector emerges from a more fundamental operation: the direct geometric product of the real electric field vector E and the magnetic field bivector B. The energy flux is the vector part of this product:
S = (1/μ₀) · ⟨E B⟩₁
This is no longer an algebraic abstraction. It has a direct physical interpretation: S is the directed area through which energy flows, constructed from the geometric relationship between the real E and B fields.
Using GA, provides the exact direction and intuition that is lacking with the complex / real representation of the Poynting vector that instructs the reader to disregard the complex terms. Now everything is real and physical thanks to Clifford Geometric Algebra.
3.2. The Rotating Wave Vector
This framework provides a tangible picture of wave propagation that aligns perfectly with our physical intuition. As the wave progresses through space (i.e., as the k·x term in the phase θ(X) changes), the cos(θ) and sin(θ) terms vary.
This causes the multivector field F(X) to execute a continuous, real rotation in the plane defined by the bivector B.
We now observe the oscillating electric and magnetic fields are simply the projections of this rotating multivector onto our spatial axes. The "wave vector"—the orientation of the fields—literally and physically rotates as the wave progresses. This provides a clear, mechanistic, and intuitive answer to the question of what is "waving" in an electromagnetic wave: it is the orientation of the field's geometric structure itself.
4. Conclusion
This Cl(3,3) phase-space model offers a compelling alternative representation for photon dynamics. By eliminating the need for complex numbers and re-parameterizing time, it grounds wave mechanics in tangible, real-valued geometry. The resulting physical picture, particularly the geometric Poynting vector and the explicitly rotating wave vector, provides a level of intuition that complements and extends the powerful geometric work already done.
