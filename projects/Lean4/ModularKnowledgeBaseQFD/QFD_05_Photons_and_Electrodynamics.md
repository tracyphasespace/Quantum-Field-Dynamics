# QFD Module 05: Photons & Electrodynamics

## 1. The Photon Soliton

The Photon is not a point particle. It is a **Propagating Toroidal Soliton** ("Flying Smoke Ring").
*   **Structure**: A vortex ring of the $\psi$-field gradient.
*   **Propulsion**: Poloidal flow drives it forward at $c = \sqrt{\beta/\rho}$.
*   **Spin**: Helical winding on the torus surface.

## 2. Helicity-Locking & Quantization

Why $E = \hbar \omega$?
*   **Mechanism**: **Helicity Locking**.
    For the knot to remain stable (not unravel), the Energy (tension) must scale linearly with the Frequency (winding density).
*   **$\hbar_{eff}$**: Not a fundamental constant, but a derived property of the stable soliton family.

## 3. Polarization as Geometry

*   **Linear Polarization**: The ring is flat (like a rolling wheel).
*   **Circular Polarization**: The ring is twisted (Hopf fibration).
*   **Selection Rules**: Atomic absorption is "Gear Meshing". The photon's thread pitch ($\\omega$) must match the electron's orbital harmonic.

## 4. The Casimir Effect

Reinterpreted as **Mode Restriction**.
*   Conducting plates restrict the allowed soliton modes in the gap.
*   Fewer allowed modes = Lower Vacuum Stress inside.
*   Result: Net inward pressure.
*   QFD adds: High-frequency cutoff due to vacuum nonlinearity ($\\lambda$).
