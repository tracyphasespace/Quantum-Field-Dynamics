# QFD Module 06: Gravity & Refraction

## 1. Gravity as Refraction

Gravity is not spacetime curvature. It is **Variable Vacuum Refractive Index**.
*   **Mechanism**: Mass increases the local scalar field density $\psi_s$.
*   **Consequence**: High $\psi_s$ increases the "Optical Density" of the vacuum.
*   **Speed of Light**: $c' = c_{vac} / \sqrt{h(\psi_s)}$. Light physically slows down near mass.
*   **Time Dilation**: $dt/d\tau \propto 1/\sqrt{h(\psi_s)}$. Clocks physically slow down.

## 2. The Two-Fold Light Deflection

QFD reproduces the GR prediction ($4GM/rc^2$) via two combined effects:
1.  **Refraction ($2GM/rc^2$)**: The wavefront pivots due to the velocity gradient (Snell's Law).
2.  **Gradient Force ($2GM/rc^2$)**: The photon soliton couples directly to the $\psi_s$ gradient (Potential Energy term in Lagrangian).

## 3. Deriving G (The Hierarchy Problem)

Why is Gravity $10^{39}$ times weaker than EM?
*   **Reason**: **Dimensional Projection**.
    *   EM couples to the 4D Surface.
    *   Gravity couples to the 6D Volume.
*   **Calculation**:
    $$ \xi_{QFD} = k_{geom}^2 \times (5/6) \approx 16.0 $$
    The factor $5/6$ accounts for the "active" dimensions. This geometric ratio naturally produces the hierarchy scale without fine-tuning.

## 4. Zombie Galaxies

*   **Prediction**: In cosmic voids (low $\psi_s$), gravity is weaker, and evolutionary clocks run faster. Galaxies burn out and become dark ("Zombie") remnants.
*   **Dark Matter**: Not needed. The "missing mass" is simply these non-luminous, ordinary-matter remnants residing in the voids.
