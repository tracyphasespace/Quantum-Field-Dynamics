# QFD Module 02: Time & Dimensional Reduction

## 1. Emergent Time (\(\tau\)\( vs \(t_{local}\))

QFD posits a **Timeless Universe** ordered by a dimensionless parameter \(\tau\).

*   **\(\tau\)\( Tau)**: The Global Ordering Parameter. Counts the sequence of static field configurations ("Frames"). It is a positive scalar and strictly monotonic.
*   **\(t_{local}\)\( Physical Time)**: The local rate of change observed by a system.
*   **The Mechanism**: The "flow" of time is determined by the local density of the \(\psi\)-field. High density = Slow Time ("Temporal Quagmire").
    $$ \frac{dt_{local}}{d\tau} \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{h(\psi_s)}} $$ 
    *   This unifies Gravitational Time Dilation and Refractive Index.

## 2. Dimensional Reduction (6D \(\to\) 4D)

Why do we see 3 Space + 1 Time?

*   **The Problem**: We exist in a 6C Phase Space (\(x^1, x^2, x^3, p^1, p^2, p^3\)).
*   **The Mechanism**: **Geodesic Coherence**.
    A stable particle (wavelet) has intrinsic spin. This spin defines a preferred axis in momentum space (Longitudinal Axis, \(p_L\)).
*   **Transmutation**: The dynamics along the Longitudinal Axis (\(p_L\)) are inextricably coupled to the internal phase rotation (\(\theta\)) of the wavelet. To an observer made of such wavelets, motion along \(p_L\) is experienced as **Time Evolution**.
    $$ p_L \to \text{Time Axis} $$ 
*   **Integration**: The two Transverse Momentum coordinates (\(p_{T1}, p_{T2}\)) are "integrated out" (averaged). Their energy content is not lost; it becomes the **Rest Mass** of the particle.

## 3. The Emergent Wave Equation

Reducing the 6C Lagrangian to the effective 4D frame yields the **QFD Wavelet Equation**:

$$ (B_k \hbar_{eff} \gamma^\mu D_\mu - m_{eff} c_{vac}) \psi_{eff} = \mathcal{N}[\psi_{eff}] $$ 

*   **\(B_k\)**: The geometric bivector (\(B_k^2 = -1\)), replacing \(i\).
*   **\(\hbar_{eff}\)**: Emergent Planck constant, derived from vacuum scales \(P_0 L_0\).
*   **\(\gamma^\mu\)**: Emergent Dirac matrices.
*   **\(\mathcal{N}\)**: Nonlinear self-interaction terms (soliton stability).

## 4. Resolving Paradoxes

*   **Time Travel**: Impossible. \(\tau\) is a counter, not a dimension. You cannot "go back" to a previous frame any more than you can un-run a computer simulation.
*   **Arrow of Time**: Statistical preference for higher-entropy configurations in the "Minimize \(\Delta \tau\)" path.
*   **Entanglement**: **The Global Rotor**. Two "entangled" particles are just two ends of a single, non-local geometric rotor structure in 6D space. Measurement projects the global orientation; no signal travels between them.
