# QFD Module 07: Cosmology, Redshift & CMB

## 1. The Static Universe

QFD rejects the Big Bang and Metric Expansion. The Universe is **Static, Infinite, and Eternal**.

## 2. Redshift as Energy Loss ("Cooling")

Redshift is not Doppler. It is cumulative energy exchange with the $\psi$-vacuum.
*   **Mechanism**: **Cosmic Drag**. Photon solitons lose infinitesimal energy to the vacuum background over distance.
*   **Formula**: $E(D) = E_0 e^{-\alpha_{drag} D}$.
*   **Hubble Law**: $z \approx \frac{H_0}{c} D$ is the low-energy limit.
*   **Anomalous Dimming**: Distant Supernovae dim because of scattering (loss of photons from the beam), not acceleration.
*   **The "Ghost"**: High-z Supernovae look like "cooled" versions of local ones. Time dilation is the broadening of the pulse due to this cooling.

## 3. The CMB: Thermal Equilibrium

The CMB is not a relic. It is the **Present-Day Equilibrium State** of the photon gas.
*   **Source**: Starlight thermalized by vacuum interactions over infinite time.
*   **Temperature**: $T_{CMB} = 2.725$ K is the equilibrium constant of the current epoch.
*   **Derivation**: The photon-photon scattering kernel (mediated by $\psi$) drives any input spectrum to a Planck distribution.

## 4. The Axis of Evil

The alignment of CMB multipoles with the Solar System is real, not a fluke.
*   **Cause**: **Survivor Bias**.
*   **Mechanism**: The Observer's motion through the $\psi$-field creates an axisymmetric polarization filter. Only photons aligned with this axis survive the cosmic journey to be detected.
*   **Prediction**: E-mode polarization will be strictly aligned with the temperature quadrupole axis.
