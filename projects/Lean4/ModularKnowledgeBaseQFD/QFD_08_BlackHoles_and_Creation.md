# QFD Module 08: Black Holes & Creation

## 1. The QFD Black Hole (Soliton)

Black Holes are not Singularities. They are **Hyper-Saturated Solitons**.
*   **Structure**:
    *   **Atmosphere**: Proton-Electron Plasma (Hydrogen).
    *   **Mantle**: Superfluid Helium-4 (Alpha particles).
    *   **Core**: Neutron/Heavy-Nuclei Condensate (Crystalline).
*   **Physics**: Inside, field density $\psi_s$ is so high that time effectively stops ($dt/d\tau \to 0$). The "Singularity" is just a region of frozen time.

## 2. The Rift Mechanism

How matter is created/recycled.
*   **Event**: Interaction between two Black Holes (Merger or Flyby).
*   **The Rift**: Tidal forces tear the vacuum surface, allowing the pressurized interior plasma to escape.
*   **Filtering**:
    *   **Shallow Rift**: Ejects H (Protons). Replenishes cosmic fuel.
    *   **Deep Rift**: Ejects He (Alphas). Replenishes Helium.
    *   **Violent Rift**: Ejects Heavy Metals. Seeds life.
    *   This explains the 75% H / 25% He cosmic abundance as a dynamic equilibrium, not a Big Bang relic.

## 3. Galactic Forensics

*   **Morphology is History**: The shape of a galaxy (spiral arms, bar, ring) is the frozen "splash pattern" of the Black Hole interaction that formed it.
*   **Forensic Tool**: The QFD simulation can "read" a galaxy shape to determine the mass ratio and trajectory of the ancient merger.
*   **Hierarchy**:
    *   Small Flyby $\to$ Brown Dwarfs / Globular Clusters.
    *   Medium Merger $\to$ Solar Systems / Star formation.
    *   Giant Merger $\to$ Grand Design Spiral Galaxy.
