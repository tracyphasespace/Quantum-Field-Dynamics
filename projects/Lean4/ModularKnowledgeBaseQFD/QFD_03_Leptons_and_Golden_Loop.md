# QFD Module 03: Leptons & The Golden Loop

## 1. The Golden Loop: $\alpha \to \beta$

The defining calculation of QFD. It derives the Vacuum Stiffness ($\beta$) from the Fine Structure Constant ($\alpha$). 

**Hypothesis**: The Electron is a stable Toroidal Vortex. Stability requires a balance between the "Winding Energy" (Surface, $\alpha$) and "Vacuum Compression" (Volume, $\beta$).

**The Equation**:
$$ \pi^2 e^\beta \left( \frac{\beta}{c_1} \right) = \alpha^{-1} $$
Where $c_1 \approx 1/2(1-\alpha)$.

**Result**:
Input $\alpha = 1/137.035999...$ $\implies$ **$\beta \approx 3.043233053...$**

This value of $\beta$ is then used to derive the Proton Mass (see Module 04).

## 2. Lepton Topology: The Hill Spherical Vortex

QFD models Leptons (Electron, Muon, Tau) not as points, but as **Hill Spherical Vortices**.
*   **Structure**: A toroidal flow of the $\psi$-field.
*   **Charge Mechanism**: **Cavitation**. The flow velocity at the core exceeds the vacuum speed of sound ($c$), creating a "void" (zero density). This void is the quantum of negative charge.
*   **Mass**: Residual energy.
    $$ \text{Mass} = \text{Circulation Energy} - |\text{Vacuum Stabilization Energy}| $$
    The electron mass (0.511 MeV) is the tiny "rounding error" between two massive energies (the cost to spin vs. the energy released by the potential well).

## 3. The D-Flow Geometry

Detailed analysis of the vortex streamlines reveals a "D-Shape" cross-section.
*   **Compression Ratio**: Path length ratio between Outer Arch and Inner Chord is $\pi/2 \approx 1.57$.
*   **Consequence**: Fluid must accelerate by 57% in the core, driving Cavitation.

## 4. The Numerical Zeeman Probe ($g-2$)

QFD explains the anomalous magnetic moment ($g-2$) as a **Geometric Form Factor**.
*   Standard QED: $C_2 \approx -0.328$ (Vertex Correction).
*   QFD: $V_4 \approx -0.326$ (Vortex Shape Factor).
    *   **Electron**: Large radius ("Soft" vortex) $\to$ Negative correction.
    *   **Muon**: Small radius ("Stiff" vortex) $\to$ Positive correction.
    *   The "Sign Flip" between Electron and Muon $g-2$ contributions is explained by the transition from Bulk-dominated to Surface-dominated regimes.
