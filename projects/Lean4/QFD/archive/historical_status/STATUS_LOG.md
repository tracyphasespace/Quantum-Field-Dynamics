# STATUS_LOG.md — Historical Status Documents (Archived)

This log captures the legacy status files that accumulated under
`archive/historical_status/`.  Each entry references the original file so we
can keep track of what it covered without duplicating narrative across the
active documentation set.

| File | Scope / Notes |
|------|---------------|
| `APPENDIX_N_PROGRESS.md` | Early draft notes for Appendix N; superseded by `NUCLEAR_ELECTRONIC_BRIDGE.md`. |
| `AXIOM_ELIMINATION_STATUS.md` | Snapshot of Lean axiom-removal progress prior to RC1. |
| `CHARGE_FORMALIZATION_COMPLETE.md` | Initial summary of charge-sector Lean proofs. |
| `CHARGE_FORMALIZATION_COMPLETE_V2.md` | Updated charge status; both versions retained for reference only. |
| `CHARGE_STATUS.md` | High-level progress log for charge-sector automation. |
| `CHARGE_VERSION_COMPARISON.md` | Comparison between charge V1/V2 approaches. |
| `DOCUMENTATION_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md` | Running list of doc changes made during 2024–2025 iterations. |
| `EMERGENT_ALGEBRA_COMPLETE.md` | Status of Emergent Algebra proofs before consolidation. |
| `EMERGENT_ALGEBRA_HEAVY_STATUS.md` | Heavy-weight derivations log for the same effort. |
| `FORMALIZATION_COMPLETE.md` | Umbrella “100% proved” claim from an earlier milestone. |
| `GRAND_SOLVER_ARCHITECTURE.md` | Description of solver APIs predating RC1. |
| `GRAVITY_FORMALIZATION_STATUS.md` | Gravity-sector completion notes. |
| `NEUTRINO_BLEACHING_STATUS.md` | Neutrino bleaching analysis archive. |
| `NEUTRINO_STATUS.md` | General neutrino formalization status. |
| `NO_FILTERS_STATUS.md` | Companion to the “no filters” gravity rewrite. |
| `NUCLEAR_FORMALIZATION_STATUS.md` | Nuclear-sector Lean status prior to the current README. |
| `PROOF_INDEX_GUIDE.md` | Legacy instructions for navigating the proof index. |
| `PROOF_INDEX_README.md` | Redundant proof index README (see `QFD/PROOF_INDEX.md`). |
| `QFD_COMPLETE_FORMALIZATION.md` | Older umbrella status; kept only for record. |
| `QFD_FORMALIZATION_STATUS.md` | Another duplicate of project-wide status. |
| `SOLVER_API_COMPLETE.md` | Legacy solver API notes. |
| `SPEC_COMPLETE.md` | Early “spec complete” announcement. |

Going forward:
- Only one current status entry per topic should live in the main docs.
- Any future snapshots should be appended here with a date stamp rather than
  creating new standalone markdown files.
