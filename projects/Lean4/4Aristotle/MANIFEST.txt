# Aristotle Submission Manifest
# Date: 2026-01-02
# Goal: Eliminate 2 measure theory axioms from VortexStability.lean

## Files in This Submission

1. VortexStability.lean (33KB, 883 lines)
   - PRIMARY FILE: Contains 2 axioms to eliminate
   - Current: 2 axioms, 0 sorries
   - Goal: 0 axioms, 0 sorries
   
2. SUBMISSION_INSTRUCTIONS.md (4.4KB)
   - TECHNICAL SPEC: Detailed requirements for axiom elimination
   - Includes: Current axioms, desired implementations, Mathlib imports
   - Success criteria and proof strategy

3. README.md (3.2KB)
   - CONTEXT: Background on Aristotle integration workflow
   - Previous successes: 8 files integrated
   - Build instructions and expected outcome

4. WHY_THIS_MATTERS.md (4.3KB)
   - MOTIVATION: Scientific significance of this work
   - The claim: Spin S = ℏ/2 is geometric, not quantum
   - Impact if successful: First formal proof of emergent spin

5. MANIFEST.txt (this file)
   - Quick reference for all submission files

## Quick Start

1. Read: WHY_THIS_MATTERS.md (understand the goal)
2. Review: SUBMISSION_INSTRUCTIONS.md (technical requirements)
3. Process: VortexStability.lean (eliminate axioms)
4. Verify: Build with `lake build QFD.Lepton.VortexStability`

## Target Axioms

Line 721: axiom energyBasedDensity
Line 729: axiom energyDensity_normalization

Both are measure theory placeholders for density integrals.

## Success Metric

✅ Axioms: 2 → 0
✅ Sorries: 0 → 0 (maintain)
✅ Build: Successful
✅ Physical meaning: Preserved (spin = angular momentum of flywheel)
