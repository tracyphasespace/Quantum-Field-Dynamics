## Figure 1: RADIAL PATTERN IN 15-PATH GEOMETRIC QUANTIZATION

**6-panel comprehensive analysis showing the discovered radial pattern**

### Panel A: 15-Path Population Distribution

Stacked bar chart showing the distribution of all 285 stable nuclei across the 15 discrete geometric paths (N ∈ {-3.5, -3.0, -2.5, ..., +3.5} with ΔN = 0.5 increment). Blue bars represent even-even nuclei (Z even, A-Z even, geometric double parity), coral bars represent odd-A nuclei (parity breaking). Gold background highlights extreme deformation paths (|N| ≥ 2.5), white background shows central paths (|N| < 2.5). Green triangles (▼) below x-axis mark integer paths (N = -3, -2, -1, 0, +1, +2, +3).

**Key observations**:
- Path -2.0 (integer) has highest population: 43 nuclei
- Extreme paths (gold regions) show strong even-even preference
- Central paths show mixed parity distribution
- Asymmetry: Negative paths (envelope-dominated) more populated than positive (core-dominated)

### Panel B: Radial Pattern - % Even-Even vs |N|

Scatter plot showing the percentage of even-even nuclei as a function of deformation magnitude |N|. Each point represents one path, with marker size proportional to population. Gold points mark extreme paths (|N| ≥ 2.5), gray points mark central paths (|N| < 2.5). Horizontal dashed lines show average even-even percentage for each region. Vertical red dotted line marks the boundary at |N| = 2.5.

**Radial pattern discovered**:
- Extreme deformations (|N| ≥ 2.5): 75.0% even-even (gold average line)
- Central deformations (|N| < 2.5): 53.8% even-even (gray average line)
- Δ = +21.2% stronger even-even preference at extreme deformations

**Physical interpretation**: Extreme geometric deformations require the ℤ₂ × ℤ₂ parity symmetry (geometric pairing) for stability. Moderate deformations can tolerate parity breaking.

### Panel C: Tin Isotopic Chain - 15-Path Assignments

Progression plot showing all 10 stable tin isotopes (Z = 50) with their 15-path assignments. Gray line connects consecutive isotopes, showing the path quantum number evolution as soliton mass increases from A = 112 to 124 AMU. Blue circles represent even-even isotopes, coral circles represent odd-A. Green dashed horizontal lines mark integer path values. Labels show the mass number for each isotope.

**Critical discovery**: Sn-116 (A = 116, even-even) and Sn-117 (A = 117, odd-A) occupy the **SAME path** (N = -2.0), indicated by red double-headed arrow labeled "ΔN = 0!" This demonstrates the nonlinear relationship between mass increment (ΔA = 1 AMU) and deformation increment (ΔN = 0.0).

**Path assignments**:
- Sn-112: N = -3.5 (half-integer, even-even)
- Sn-114: N = -3.0 (integer, even-even)
- Sn-115: N = -2.5 (half-integer, odd-A)
- Sn-116: N = -2.0 (integer, even-even)
- Sn-117: N = -2.0 (integer, odd-A) ← **Same as Sn-116!**
- Sn-118: N = -1.5 (half-integer, even-even)
- Sn-119: N = -1.0 (integer, odd-A)
- Sn-120: N = -0.5 (half-integer, even-even)
- Sn-122: N = +0.5 (half-integer, even-even)
- Sn-124: N = +1.0 (integer, even-even)

**Spacing pattern**: ΔN values vary (0.0, 0.5, 1.0), not uniformly 0.5.

### Panel D: Hypothesis Test - Integer vs Half-Integer

Bar chart comparing the even-even percentage for integer paths (N = -3, -2, -1, 0, +1, +2, +3) versus half-integer paths (N = -3.5, -2.5, -1.5, -0.5, +0.5, +1.5, +2.5, +3.5). Integer paths shown in light green, half-integer in light coral. Horizontal dashed line at 50% marks equal distribution. Text annotations show exact percentages above bars.

**Hypothesis tested**: "Integer paths should prefer even-even nuclei (representing fundamental ΔA = 2 AMU sector)"

**Result**:
- Integer paths: 56.4% even-even
- Half-integer paths: **60.0% even-even**

**Verdict**: HYPOTHESIS REVERSED! Half-integer paths show slightly MORE even-even preference, indicated by red "REVERSED!" text in yellow warning box. This disproves the simple integer/half-integer separation hypothesis.

### Panel E: Radial Pattern - Extreme vs Central

Bar chart comparing even-even percentage for extreme deformation paths (|N| ≥ 2.5) versus central paths (|N| < 2.5). Extreme paths shown in gold, central in light gray. Text annotations show exact percentages and the difference (Δ = +21.1%).

**Correct pattern discovered**:
- Extreme paths (|N| ≥ 2.5): 75.0% even-even
- Central paths (|N| < 2.5): 53.8% even-even

**Verdict**: CONFIRMED (green text, light green success box). This is the TRUE physics: radial pattern based on deformation magnitude, NOT integer vs half-integer classification.

### Panel F: Coefficient Evolution Comparison

Line plot comparing the c₁/c₂ ratio evolution for 7-path model (blue solid line) versus 15-path model (red dashed line) across the full N range (-3.5 to +3.5). Blue circles mark the 7 actual path locations in the 7-path model, red circles mark the 12 populated paths in the 15-path model (3 paths are unpopulated: +2.0, +3.0, +3.5).

**Key finding**: The 15-path model coefficients are NOT simply the 7-path coefficients with halved increments. The curves diverge, showing that the 15-path model represents a genuinely different geometric structure, not just a rescaling.

**Physical meaning**: The c₁/c₂ ratio represents the balance between surface curvature (envelope) and volume (core). Both models show monotonic decrease from N = -3.5 (envelope-dominated, ratio ≈ 4.6) to N = +3.5 (core-dominated, ratio ≈ 3.3), but with different slopes reflecting different geometric interpretations.

## Figure 2: NONLINEAR MASS-DEFORMATION RELATIONSHIP IN 15-PATH MODEL

**4-panel analysis of the complex ΔA → ΔN mapping**

### Panel A: Nonlinear ΔA → ΔN Relationship

Scatter plot showing all isotopic chain transitions for 5 representative elements (Ca, Ni, Sn, Xe, Pb) in the plane of mass increment (ΔA, x-axis) vs deformation increment (ΔN, y-axis). Each point represents one isotope-to-isotope transition. Circles mark even-even → even-even transitions (both isotopes have double parity), triangles mark transitions crossing odd-A (parity change). Different colors distinguish the 5 elements.

**Reference lines**:
- Black dashed: ΔN = ΔA (linear relationship - would be true if deformation scaled directly with mass)
- Red dashed: ΔN = ΔA/2 (half-linear - expected if ΔA = 2 AMU maps to ΔN = 1.0)

**Observed pattern**: Points scatter across the plane, showing NO simple linear relationship. For the same ΔA value, different ΔN values are observed (0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5), depending on the specific (A, Z) configuration.

**Key observation**: Most transitions lie below the ΔN = ΔA line, indicating that deformation changes more slowly than mass. But the relationship is complex, not simply ΔN = ΔA/2.

### Panel B: Distribution of ΔN in Isotopic Chains

Histogram showing the frequency distribution of ΔN values for all isotope-to-isotope transitions across all elements. Bins width = 0.25 units. Bars are color-coded:
- Red: ΔN < 0 (deformation decreases - rare)
- Green: ΔN ≈ 0.5 (most common)
- Gold: ΔN ≈ 1.0 (common)
- Blue: Other positive ΔN values

**Statistical analysis**:
- Mean ΔN: shown by red vertical dashed line
- Median ΔN: shown by blue vertical dashed line
- Peak at ΔN = 0.5 (green bar, highest frequency)
- Secondary peak at ΔN = 1.0 (gold bar)
- Rare events: ΔN = 0.0 (same path) and ΔN < 0 (deformation reversal)

**Interpretation**: While ΔN = 0.5 is most common (consistent with 15 paths spaced by ΔN = 0.5), the distribution shows significant width, proving the relationship between mass spacing (ΔA) and deformation spacing (ΔN) is **nonlinear and context-dependent**.

### Panel C: Tin Ladder - ΔA and ΔN Transitions

Detailed transition diagram for the tin isotopic chain (Z = 50) showing every consecutive isotope pair connected by arrows. Each arrow is labeled with the transition (ΔA, ΔN) values. Points marked with blue circles (isotope locations in (A, N) space). Text annotations show A values below each point.

**Transitions analyzed**:
1. Sn-112 → Sn-114: Δ(2, +0.5) - even-even to even-even, ΔA = 2 gives ΔN = 0.5
2. Sn-114 → Sn-115: Δ(1, +0.5) - even-even to odd-A, ΔA = 1 gives ΔN = 0.5
3. Sn-115 → Sn-116: Δ(1, +0.5) - odd-A to even-even, ΔA = 1 gives ΔN = 0.5
4. **Sn-116 → Sn-117: Δ(1, 0.0)** - even-even to odd-A, ΔA = 1 gives **ΔN = 0.0** (same path!)
5. Sn-117 → Sn-118: Δ(1, +0.5) - odd-A to even-even, ΔA = 1 gives ΔN = 0.5
6. Sn-118 → Sn-119: Δ(1, +0.5) - even-even to odd-A, ΔA = 1 gives ΔN = 0.5
7. Sn-119 → Sn-120: Δ(1, +0.5) - odd-A to even-even, ΔA = 1 gives ΔN = 0.5
8. **Sn-120 → Sn-122: Δ(2, +1.0)** - even-even to even-even, ΔA = 2 gives **ΔN = 1.0** (skips N = 0!)
9. Sn-122 → Sn-124: Δ(2, +0.5) - even-even to even-even, ΔA = 2 gives ΔN = 0.5

**Critical insight**: The "2 AMU quantum" in the even-even sector does NOT uniformly map to ΔN = 1.0. Sometimes ΔA = 2 gives ΔN = 0.5 (transitions 1 and 9), sometimes ΔN = 1.0 (transition 8). The mapping is **highly nonlinear**.

### Panel D: Path Populations (Bubble Plot)

Scatter plot with path quantum number N on x-axis and population (number of nuclei) on y-axis. Each path represented by a colored bubble, with:
- **Bubble size**: Proportional to population (larger = more nuclei)
- **Bubble color**: % even-even (red = 0%, white = 50%, blue = 100%)
- **Green circles**: Overlay on integer paths (N = -3, -2, -1, 0, +1, +2, +3)

**Colorbar**: Shows mapping from % even-even to color (0-100%).

**Key patterns**:
1. **Population asymmetry**: Negative paths (N < 0) have larger bubbles than positive paths
2. **Color gradient**: Extreme paths (|N| ≥ 2.5) are bluer (higher % even-even), central paths are redder/whiter
3. **Missing paths**: No bubbles at N = +2.0, +3.0, +3.5 (these paths are unpopulated in the 285 stable nuclei)
4. **Integer paths**: Some integer paths (like N = +1.0) are very blue (100% even-even), others (like N = -2.0) are white (mixed parity)

**Physical interpretation**: The radial pattern is clearly visible in the color distribution. Extreme deformations (far from N = 0) favor geometric parity (blue), moderate deformations (near N = 0) accept parity breaking (red/white). The population asymmetry suggests envelope-dominated configurations (N < 0) are more common than core-dominated (N > 0) in stable nuclei.

## KEY DISCOVERIES ILLUSTRATED

### Discovery 1: Radial Pattern (Figure 1, Panels B and E)

**What we expected**: Integer paths prefer even-even, half-integer prefer odd-A

**What we found**: Extreme deformation (|N| ≥ 2.5) prefers even-even (75%), regardless of integer vs half-integer

**Evidence**: Panel B shows clear clustering of high % even-even at large |N|. Panel E quantifies: extreme vs central difference is +21.1%.

**Interpretation**: The ℤ₂ × ℤ₂ geometric parity symmetry (even-even) enables access to extreme soliton deformations. Parity breaking (odd-A) restricts nuclei to moderate deformations.

### Discovery 2: Nonlinear ΔA → ΔN (Figure 2, Panels A and C)

**What we expected**: ΔA = 2 AMU (even-even spacing) maps to ΔN = 1.0 (integer path spacing)

**What we found**: Same ΔA can give different ΔN depending on (A, Z)
- Sn-112 → Sn-114: ΔA = 2, ΔN = 0.5
- Sn-120 → Sn-122: ΔA = 2, ΔN = 1.0
- Sn-116 → Sn-117: ΔA = 1, ΔN = 0.0 (same path!)

**Evidence**: Panel A shows scatter in ΔA-ΔN plane (no simple line). Panel C shows specific tin examples with variable ΔN for same ΔA.

**Interpretation**: The formula Z(A, N) = c₁(N)×A^(2/3) + c₂(N)×A + c₃(N) is **nonlinear in both A and N**. The relationship between mass spacing and deformation spacing depends on the specific geometric configuration, not just the mass increment.

### Discovery 3: 15 Paths, Only 12 Populated (Figure 1, Panel F and Figure 2, Panel D)

**What we tested**: 15 discrete paths with ΔN = 0.5 from N = -3.5 to +3.5

**What we found**: Only 12 paths populated in 285 stable nuclei
- **Populated**: -3.5, -3.0, -2.5, -2.0, -1.5, -1.0, -0.5, 0.0, +0.5, +1.0, +1.5, +2.5
- **Unpopulated**: +2.0, +3.0, +3.5

**Evidence**: Panel F shows red circles only on 12 paths (3 missing). Panel D shows no bubbles for the 3 missing paths.

**Question**: Are these paths physically inaccessible, or just not populated in the observed 285 stable nuclei? Could superheavy elements or exotic unstable isotopes access them?

### Discovery 4: Hypothesis Reversal (Figure 1, Panel D)

**What we hypothesized**: Integer paths (N = -3, -2, -1, 0, +1, +2, +3) should be even-even dominant, representing the fundamental ΔA = 2 AMU sector

**What we measured**:
- Integer paths: 56.4% even-even
- Half-integer paths: 60.0% even-even (HIGHER!)

**Evidence**: Panel D shows half-integer bar is taller than integer bar.

**Revised understanding**: The integer vs half-integer distinction is **NOT the fundamental physics**. The radial pattern (extreme vs central deformation) is the primary effect. Both integer and half-integer paths can have either high or low even-even percentage, depending on |N|.

## PURE QFD INTERPRETATION

All figures use **pure geometric language** (no "neutrons"):

- **Path quantum number N**: Quantized deformation state of the soliton surface
- **Soliton mass A**: Total field energy (AMU)
- **Soliton charge Z**: Topological winding number (units of e)
- **Even-even**: Geometric double parity (ℤ₂ × ℤ₂ symmetry: Z even AND A-Z even)
- **Odd-A**: Broken geometric parity
- **ΔA**: Mass increment (not "adding neutrons")
- **ΔN**: Deformation increment (not directly proportional to ΔA)

**The "2 AMU quantum"**: Represents the mass of a geometric resonance unit that preserves double parity symmetry, enabling access to extreme deformations. NOT two neutrons, but a field resonance quantum.
