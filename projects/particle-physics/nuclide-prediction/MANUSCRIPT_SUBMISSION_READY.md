## Key Scientific Points

### Primary Finding
**Asymmetric decay product resonance** (χ²=1,706, p << 10⁻³⁰⁰):
- β⁻ products: 17.0% land on charge_poor (3.40× random baseline)
- β⁺ products: 10.5% land on charge_rich (2.10× random baseline)

### Novel Contributions
1. First systematic characterization of mode-specific decay product distributions
2. Three-curve coordinated pathway system (charge_poor, charge_nominal, charge_rich)
3. Asymmetric resonance pattern not previously reported
4. Intriguing c₂ ≈ 1/β connection (4.59% error)

### Honest Framing (Critical)
- **Functional form** Q(A) = c₁·A^(2/3) + c₂·A from dimensional analysis ✓
- **Coefficients** c₁, c₂ are **empirically determined**, NOT derived from first principles
- c₂ ≈ 1/β noted as "intriguing observation" requiring theoretical investigation
- Clear statement in Section 5.4.1: "Critical acknowledgment: The stability curve parameters were determined by fitting to nuclear data, NOT derived from first principles"

## Anticipated Reviewer Questions

### Q1: "How do you know the curves weren't fitted to the same data you're testing?"
**Answer**: We acknowledge semi-empirical nature in Section 2.2.2 and 5.4.1. Coefficients were fitted to stable nuclei Z/A ratios. The key finding is the **asymmetric pattern** (β⁻ → poor, β⁺ → rich), not absolute resonance percentages. Pattern survives with alternative curve parametrizations (Appendix E).

### Q2: "Is this just a restatement that decay moves toward stability?"
**Answer**: No. We show **mode-specific** resonance with **distinct curves** for different decay modes. Standard picture has one valley; we find coordinated three-curve system with quantified enhancement factors (3.4× and 2.1×).

### Q3: "What's the physical mechanism?"
**Answer**: Proposed geometric channeling along surface tension gradients (Section 4.1-4.3). Testable via superheavy nuclei and other decay modes (Section 6).

### Q4: "Where does c₂ ≈ 1/β come from?"
**Answer**: Currently an empirical observation (4.59% agreement). We note this as requiring theoretical derivation from QFD field equations (Section 5.4.2). This is **future work**, not a claim of first-principles prediction.

### Q5: "Why should we believe QFD over quantum shell model?"
**Answer**: We don't claim QFD replaces shell model. We present **empirical finding** (resonance pattern) motivated by geometric considerations. Whether this ultimately traces to quantum effects, geometric effects, or both is open question (Section 7.5).

## Strengths of Manuscript

1. **Novel statistical finding**: χ²=1,706 is overwhelming significance
2. **Large dataset**: 2,823 transitions from authoritative database (NuBase 2020)
3. **Robust analysis**: Threshold sensitivity, mass range breakdown, parent-product comparison
4. **Honest framing**: Clear about what's empirical vs what's derived
5. **Testable predictions**: Concrete predictions for superheavy region
6. **Complete documentation**: All figures, appendices, code availability

## Weaknesses (Acknowledged in Text)

1. **Semi-empirical parametrization**: Coefficients fitted, not derived from theory
2. **Limited theoretical justification**: c₂ ≈ 1/β is observation, not derivation
3. **No half-life predictions**: Thermodynamics only, not kinetics
4. **Shell effects not fully addressed**: Possible role of quantum shells (Section 5.3)
