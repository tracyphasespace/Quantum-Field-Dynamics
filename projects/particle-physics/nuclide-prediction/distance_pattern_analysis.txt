DECAY PATTERN ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Beta-minus isotopes (n→p, Z increases): 1611
  Mean signed distance to each curve:
    charge_poor       :  +2.1530 Z  (above curve)
    charge_nominal    :  -2.0999 Z  (below curve)
    charge_rich       :  -6.1393 Z  (below curve)

Beta-plus isotopes (p→n, Z decreases): 1484
  Mean signed distance to each curve:
    charge_poor       :  +5.7773 Z  (above curve)
    charge_nominal    :  +1.4425 Z  (above curve)
    charge_rich       :  -2.6769 Z  (below curve)

KEY INSIGHT:
  Beta-minus (n→p) isotopes are BELOW all curves on average
  Beta-plus (p→n) isotopes are ABOVE all curves on average
  This makes physical sense: below curve = neutron-rich → beta-minus
                            above curve = proton-rich → beta-plus

PREDICTION ACCURACY BY CURVE
================================================================================

If we use charge_rich curve to predict:
  Beta-minus: 1506/1611 = 93.48%
  Beta-plus:  442/1484 = 29.78%
  → charge_rich curve is GOOD for beta-minus, BAD for beta-plus

If we use charge_poor curve to predict:
  Beta-minus: 770/1611 = 47.80%
  Beta-plus:  1484/1484 = 100.00%
  → charge_poor curve is BAD for beta-minus, PERFECT for beta-plus

If we use charge_nominal curve to predict:
  Beta-minus: 1110/1611 = 68.90%
  Beta-plus:  949/1484 = 63.95%
  → charge_nominal is mediocre for both

HYPOTHESIS: Curve Offset Optimization
================================================================================

Current setup uses three separate curves fit to minimize ChargeStress.
But maybe the curves need OFFSET adjustments to better match decay patterns.

Let me test: What if we shift the curves vertically (adjust c2)?
