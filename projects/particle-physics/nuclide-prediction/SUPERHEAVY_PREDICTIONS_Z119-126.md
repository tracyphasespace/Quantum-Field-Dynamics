# Superheavy Element Predictions: Z = 119-126

**Date**: 2025-12-30
**Method**: QFD three-regime soliton classifier
**Prediction Type**: Decay modes for unknown elements

---

## Executive Summary

Using QFD soliton geometry (three-regime curves), we predict decay modes for hypothetical superheavy elements Z = 119-126.

### Key Findings:

1. **"Island of Stability" at Z=119-120**: Isotopes ³⁰²E119 and ³⁰⁶E120 predicted **stable**
2. **Systematic transition**: Z ≥ 121 → fission dominates
3. **Neutron richness increases**: N/Z grows from 1.54 to 1.60
4. **Solitons drift BELOW stability valley**: Increasingly neutron-rich
5. **Fission fragments converge**: Around A~160, Z~60-63 (lanthanide region)

### QFD Interpretation:

**Z=119-120**: Solitons ON stability valley → metastable "island"
**Z≥121**: Solitons BELOW valley AND superheavy (A>220) → bulk topology unstable → fission

## Predicted Most Stable Isotopes

| Element | Z | Predicted A | N/Z | Decay Mode | ChargeStress | Position |
|---------|---|-------------|-----|------------|--------------|----------|
| **E119** | 119 | **302** | 1.538 | **Stable** | 0.30 | ON valley |
| **E120** | 120 | **306** | 1.550 | **Stable** | 0.77 | ON valley |
| E121 | 121 | 309 | 1.554 | Fission | 0.87 | Below valley |
| E122 | 122 | 313 | 1.566 | Fission | 1.33 | Below valley |
| E123 | 123 | 317 | 1.577 | Fission | 1.80 | Below valley |
| E124 | 124 | 320 | 1.581 | Fission | 1.90 | Below valley |
| E125 | 125 | 324 | 1.592 | Fission | 2.36 | Below valley |
| E126 | 126 | 328 | 1.603 | Fission | 2.83 | Below valley |

**QFD Prediction**: **"Island of stability" exists at Z=119-120**, but ends abruptly at Z=121.

## Pattern 1: The Stability Island (Z=119-120)

### ³⁰²E119 (Ununennium-302)

```
ChargeStress: -0.30 Z (essentially ON nominal curve)
Prediction: STABLE
Confidence: Medium
```

**QFD Soliton Structure**:
- 302 nucleons (183 neutrons, 119 protons)
- N/Z = 1.538
- Positioned 0.3 Z BELOW stability valley
- Soliton is in near-perfect balance

**Decay Products**: None (stable configuration)

**Physical meaning**: This soliton sits in the stability valley with minimal ChargeStress. The bulk-to-surface ratio allows geometric stability.

### ³⁰⁶E120 (Unbinilium-306)

```
ChargeStress: -0.77 Z (slightly below nominal)
Prediction: STABLE
Confidence: Medium
```

**QFD Soliton Structure**:
- 306 nucleons (186 neutrons, 120 protons)
- N/Z = 1.550
- Positioned 0.77 Z below stability valley
- Still geometrically stable

**Decay Products**: None (stable configuration)

**Significance**: Z=120 is the **last predicted stable element** in QFD framework.

---

## Pattern 2: Fission Dominance (Z≥121)

### The Transition at Z=121

**³⁰⁹E121**: ChargeStress = 0.87 Z → **Fission**

**Why the sudden change?**

In QFD terms:
- **Bulk instability threshold crossed**
- Soliton is both:
  1. Superheavy (A > 220) → surface tension weakening
  2. Below stability valley → neutron-rich configuration
- Combined effect → topology cannot maintain coherence → splits

### Systematic Increase in ChargeStress

| Z | ChargeStress | Interpretation |
|---|--------------|----------------|
| 119 | 0.30 | Near equilibrium |
| 120 | 0.77 | Slight stress |
| 121 | 0.87 | **Threshold crossed** |
| 122 | 1.33 | Moderate stress |
| 123 | 1.80 | High stress |
| 124 | 1.90 | High stress |
| 125 | 2.36 | Very high stress |
| 126 | 2.83 | Very high stress |

**QFD Interpretation**:
- Solitons become increasingly **neutron-rich** (below stability valley)
- ChargeStress increases **linearly** with Z (~0.5 Z per element)
- This systematic drift reflects **bulk vs surface energy imbalance**

---

## Pattern 3: N/Z Ratio Trend

### Neutron Richness Increases

| Z | N/Z | ΔN/Z per Z | Neutron Excess |
|---|-----|------------|----------------|
| 119 | 1.538 | - | 64 neutrons |
| 120 | 1.550 | +0.012 | 66 |
| 121 | 1.554 | +0.004 | 67 |
| 122 | 1.566 | +0.012 | 69 |
| 123 | 1.577 | +0.011 | 71 |
| 124 | 1.581 | +0.004 | 72 |
| 125 | 1.592 | +0.011 | 74 |
| 126 | 1.603 | +0.011 | 76 |

**Average increase**: ΔN/Z ≈ +0.009 per Z

**QFD Interpretation**:
- To maintain soliton coherence at increasing Z, neutron fraction must grow
- This reflects **charge-to-bulk ratio optimization**
- Neutrons provide bulk volume without adding charge repulsion
- Systematic trend: N = Z × (1.54 + 0.009×(Z-119))

### Comparison to Known Superheavy Elements

| Element | Z | Known A | N/Z | Predicted A | N/Z (pred) | Match? |
|---------|---|---------|-----|-------------|------------|--------|
| Oganesson | 118 | 294 | 1.492 | - | - | - |
| E119 | 119 | ? | ? | 302 | 1.538 | **Testable** |
| E120 | 120 | ? | ? | 306 | 1.550 | **Testable** |

**Experimental test**: When E119/E120 are synthesized, does N/Z ≈ 1.54?

## Pattern 4: Fission Fragment Systematics

### Predicted Fission Products (Symmetric Fission)

For elements Z ≥ 121, fission produces two roughly equal fragments:

| Parent | Z_parent | A_parent | Fragment | Z_frag | A_frag | Element |
|--------|----------|----------|----------|--------|--------|---------|
| E121 | 121 | 309 | → 2× | ~60 | ~154 | Neodymium region |
| E122 | 122 | 313 | → 2× | ~61 | ~156 | Promethium region |
| E123 | 123 | 317 | → 2× | ~61 | ~158 | Pm/Sm |
| E124 | 124 | 320 | → 2× | ~62 | ~160 | Samarium region |
| E125 | 125 | 324 | → 2× | ~62 | ~162 | Samarium region |
| E126 | 126 | 328 | → 2× | ~63 | ~164 | Europium region |

### Convergence to Lanthanide Region

**All fission fragments land in Z = 60-63 (lanthanides)**:
- Nd (Z=60), Pm (Z=61), Sm (Z=62), Eu (Z=63)

**QFD Significance**:
- Fission doesn't split randomly
- Fragments converge to **A~160, Z~60-63**
- This region must be energetically favorable for fission products

**Why lanthanides?**

In QFD terms:
- A~160 is optimal soliton size for stability
- Z~60 balances charge and bulk
- Fission releases ChargeStress by creating two medium-mass solitons
- These are closer to stability valley than parent superheavy

### Fragment ChargeStress Check

For ¹⁶⁰Sm (Z=62, A=160):
```python
ChargeStress ≈ 0.5-1.0 Z (estimated)
```

Much lower than parent ChargeStress (2-3 Z), confirming fission reduces stress.

## Pattern 5: Decay Mode Distribution

### Fraction of Isotopes by Decay Mode

For each element, tested 7 isotopes around predicted stability:

| Z | Fission | Stable | Beta-plus | Total |
|---|---------|--------|-----------|-------|
| 119 | 57% | 29% | 14% | 7 |
| 120 | 57% | 43% | 0% | 7 |
| 121 | 71% | 29% | 0% | 7 |
| 122 | 71% | 29% | 0% | 7 |
| 123 | 71% | 29% | 0% | 7 |
| 124 | 71% | 29% | 0% | 7 |
| 125 | 71% | 29% | 0% | 7 |
| 126 | 71% | 29% | 0% | 7 |

**Observations**:
1. **Z=119**: Mixed (fission + stable + beta)
2. **Z=120**: Transition (fission + stable, no beta)
3. **Z≥121**: Dominated by fission (71%), with narrow stable window (29%)

### The "Stable Window"

Even for Z ≥ 121, there's a **narrow window** of ~2 isotopes predicted stable:
- These are very close to nominal curve (|ChargeStress| < 0.8 Z)
- They're "metastable" - fission competes but geometry holds (barely)

**QFD**: Soliton surface tension is just strong enough to maintain topology for these specific N/Z ratios.

## Pattern 6: Soliton Geometry Visualization

### Position Relative to Stability Valley

```
         Proton-rich
              ↑
    +4 Z ─────┼─────
              │
    +3 Z ─────┼───── E119 (light isotopes)
              │
    +2 Z ─────┼─────
              │
    +1 Z ─────┼─────
              │
  Nominal ────┼●●─── E119-120 (stable) ← ISLAND OF STABILITY
              │
    -1 Z ─────┼●──── E121-122
              │
    -2 Z ─────┼──●── E123-125
              │
    -3 Z ─────┼───● E126
              │
         Neutron-rich
              ↓
```

**Trend**: Most stable isotopes drift **systematically below** stability valley as Z increases.

**QFD Meaning**:
- Superheavy solitons need neutron excess to stabilize
- But this moves them away from valley → increases ChargeStress
- Eventually ChargeStress + bulk instability → fission

---

## Comparison to Standard Nuclear Physics Predictions

### "Island of Stability" Concept

**Standard physics** (shell model):
- Predicts "island" near Z=114-126, N=184
- Based on shell closures (magic numbers)
- Deformed nuclei with enhanced stability

**QFD prediction**:
- "Island" at Z=119-120 (³⁰²E119, ³⁰⁶E120)
- Based on soliton geometry (ChargeStress minimum)
- No shell closures - pure topology

**Key difference**:
- Standard: N=184 is magic (Z can vary)
- QFD: Specific (A,Z) pairs minimize ChargeStress

### Predicted vs Standard Locations

| Theory | Island Center | Mechanism |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| **Standard (shell)** | Z=114-126, N=184 | Quantum shell closure |
| **QFD (soliton)** | Z=119-120, N≈183-186 | Geometric stress minimum |

**Overlap region**: Both predict stability around Z~120, N~184

**Experimental test**: Synthesize isotopes and measure half-lives
- If ³⁰²E119 is long-lived → QFD validated
- If N=184 is special for all Z → standard physics validated
- Could be BOTH (shell + geometry)

---

## Testable Predictions

### Prediction 1: ³⁰²E119 is Stable (or Very Long-Lived)

**QFD**: ChargeStress = 0.30 Z → near stability valley

**Test**: Synthesize ³⁰²E119 and measure half-life
- If t₁/₂ > 1 year: Strong QFD validation
- If t₁/₂ < 1 second: QFD failed

**Note**: "Stable" in QFD might mean t₁/₂ ~ years, not infinite

### Prediction 2: ³⁰⁶E120 is Stable (or Very Long-Lived)

**QFD**: ChargeStress = 0.77 Z → slightly below valley

**Test**: Synthesize ³⁰⁶E120
- If t₁/₂ > 1 day: QFD partially validated
- Should be less stable than ³⁰²E119 (higher stress)

### Prediction 3: Z≥121 Undergo Fission Rapidly

**QFD**: ChargeStress > 0.87 Z + superheavy → fission dominates

**Test**: Synthesize E121-126
- If all fission with t₁/₂ < 1 second: QFD validated
- If some are long-lived: Need to refine threshold

### Prediction 4: Fission Fragments are Lanthanides

**QFD**: Symmetric fission → Z~60-63, A~154-164

**Test**: Measure fission fragment mass distribution
- If peak around A~160, Z~60: QFD validated
- If asymmetric fission: Need to update model

### Prediction 5: N/Z Ratio Trend

**QFD**: N/Z ≈ 1.54 + 0.009×(Z-119)

**Test**: Synthesize multiple isotopes of each element
- Measure which N/Z gives longest half-life
- Compare to predicted trend

## QFD Soliton Physics Interpretation

### Why Does the Island Exist at Z=119-120?

**Bulk-Surface Energy Balance**:

The three-regime curve formula: Q(A) = c₁·A^(2/3) + c₂·A

For superheavy elements:
- **Surface term** (c₁·A^(2/3)): Soliton surface tension
- **Bulk term** (c₂·A): Volume energy

At Z=119-120:
- A ≈ 300 → Surface ~ 44, Bulk ~ 300
- Bulk dominates by factor of ~7
- But surface tension is still strong enough to hold topology

At Z≥121:
- ChargeStress increases (neutron excess)
- Surface can no longer stabilize bulk deformation
- Soliton splits → fission

### Neutron Richness = Bulk Stabilization

**Why N/Z increases with Z?**

In QFD:
- Protons add both charge (Z) and mass
- Neutrons add only mass (bulk volume)
- To stabilize heavy solitons, need neutron-rich core
- This dilutes charge concentration
- But moves soliton away from stability valley (trade-off)

**Optimization**: Minimum ChargeStress occurs at specific N/Z for each Z

### Fission = Topology Fragmentation

**Why symmetric fission to lanthanides?**

In QFD:
- Parent soliton has high ChargeStress (far from valley)
- Splitting into two medium-mass solitons reduces total ChargeStress
- Fragments at A~160, Z~60 are near stability valley (low stress)
- Energy release = ΔStress × (coupling constant)

**Topology change**: One large soliton → two smaller solitons

---

## Systematic Trends Summary

### 1. ChargeStress Increases Linearly

**Slope**: ~0.5 Z per element (for most stable isotope)

```
ChargeStress(Z) ≈ 0.5 × (Z - 119) - 0.3

Z=119: -0.3 Z
Z=120: -0.8 Z
Z=121: -0.9 Z
Z=126: -2.8 Z
```

**Physical meaning**: Systematic drift below stability valley

### 2. N/Z Ratio Increases Linearly

**Slope**: ~0.009 per Z

```
N/Z(Z) ≈ 1.54 + 0.009 × (Z - 119)

Z=119: 1.54
Z=120: 1.55
Z=126: 1.60
```

**Physical meaning**: Neutron fraction must grow to stabilize heavy solitons

### 3. Mass Number Increases

**Slope**: ~4 nucleons per Z

```
A(Z) ≈ 302 + 4 × (Z - 119)

Z=119: A=302
Z=120: A=306
Z=126: A=328
```

**Physical meaning**: Adding 4 nucleons per proton (3 neutrons + 1 proton)

### 4. Fission Fragment Mass

**Constant**: A_fragment ≈ 154 + 2×(Z-119)

```
Z=121: A_frag ≈ 154
Z=126: A_frag ≈ 164
```

**Physical meaning**: Fragments grow slightly with parent mass, but stay in lanthanide region

## Implications for Superheavy Element Synthesis

### Synthesis Strategies

**To reach island of stability (³⁰²E119, ³⁰⁶E120)**:

Need fusion reactions that produce neutron-rich isotopes:
- **Not**: ⁴⁸Ca + actinide (gives N/Z ≈ 1.48, too low)
- **Yes**: Neutron-rich projectiles (e.g., ⁵⁰Ca, ⁵⁴Cr, ⁶⁴Ni)

**Example pathway to ³⁰²E119**:
```
⁵⁴Cr + ²⁴⁹Bk → ³⁰³E119* → ³⁰²E119 + n

Z = 24 + 97 = 121 (wrong target!)

Actually need:
⁵⁰Ti + ²⁵²Cf → ³⁰²E119*
```

**QFD guidance**: Must match N/Z ≈ 1.54 in compound nucleus

### Half-Life Expectations

**QFD thermodynamics** (ChargeStress):
- ³⁰²E119: Low stress → thermodynamically stable
- ³⁰⁶E120: Moderate stress → thermodynamically stable

**QFD kinetics** (unknown):
- We cannot predict half-life from ChargeStress alone!
- Need soliton internal structure (vortex topology)
- Could be milliseconds or years

**Conservative estimate**: If on island, expect t₁/₂ > 1 second

**Key difference**: QFD predicts more neutron-rich
