# Fast Black Hole Simulation (Refactored)

This project simulates the dynamics of particles in the gravitational field of a non-singular black hole binary system.

## Environment Notes

This simulation was developed and tested with the following key dependencies:

*   **CUDA Version:** 12.9 (as reported by `nvidia-smi`)
*   **CuPy Version:** `cupy-cuda12x==13.5.1`
*   **Python Version:** 3.13 (Note: PyTorch support for this version is experimental, CPU-only mode is recommended for stability).
