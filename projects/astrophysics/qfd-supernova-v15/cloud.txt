# Global polish (applies to all)

* Use one typeface (e.g., Arial) and the same font sizes across captions and panel letters.
* Panel style: (a), (b), (c)… in **bold**, top-left of each panel.
* Axes: “mag”, “redshift z”, “χ² per observation”, “standardized units” — use the same wording everywhere.
* Legends: lower-right unless they overlap dense points.
* Color scheme:

  * Data (points): grey/blue.
  * QFD curve: solid blue.
  * ΛCDM curve (when shown): dashed red.
  * Running median: black with dot markers.
* Zero-point: wherever residuals carry a large negative mean (because of the α→μ mapping), say so in the caption and draw a faint horizontal “0 mag” line to orient the eye.

##  — Corner plot (`fig1_corner_plot.png`)

**What works**

* Clear 1D/2D posteriors; nice ellipse showing the k_J–ξ anti-correlation.
* Helpful callouts (R̂, ESS, divergences).

**Tweak**

* Add panel letters to the 2D plots (optional), but definitely:

  * Caption explicitly report posterior means ±1σ in text (numbers already on plot are great; mirror them in the caption for doc searchability).
  * Add a one-line note: “Posterior computed with NumPyro NUTS; 4 chains × 2k samples; R̂=1.00; zero divergences.”

---

##  — MCMC traces (`fig2_mcmc_traces.png`)

**What works**

* Four chains overlayed, stationarity clear.

**Tweak**

* Add thin grey horizontal line at each parameter’s posterior mean.
* Right-side mini-legend “Chains 1–4” → compress into one legend at the top; remove repeated ones.
* Caption: “Flat traces, no drift; effective sample size >10k for each parameter.”

---

##  — Hubble diagram, QFD vs ΛCDM (`fig3_hubble_diagram.png`)

**What works**

* Two-panel layout (fit + residuals), RMS box, running median.

**Tweak**

* Title case to sentence case (“Hubble diagram: QFD vs ΛCDM”).
* Move RMS box to lower-right of residual panel.
* In caption, spell out the α→μ mapping and that the absolute μ zero-point is a free nuisance offset.

---

##  — Residual diagnostics

* You have two variants: `fig4_residual_diagnostics.png` (4-panel) and `fig06_residual_diagnostics.png` (3-panel, wide). Pick **one** for the paper (I’d keep the **3-panel wide**; it reads cleaner).

**What works**

* Histogram with mean/RMS markers, Q–Q plot curvature (heavy tails), running median vs z.

**Tweak**

* On the histogram, label the vertical dashed line “mean residual”.
* Q–Q plot: keep the red 45° reference; label tails “heavier than Gaussian”.
* Running median panel: add shaded 68% CI around the median (already present in some figs; keep consistent).

---

##  — Hubble diagram (clean QFD-only) (`_hubble_diagram.png`)




---

##  — α vs z + dα/dz (`fig07_alpha_vs_z.png`)

**What works**

* This is the “internal physics” visualization.

**Tweak**

* Replace the “violations” badge with a caption sentence explaining why monotonicity isn’t enforced in Model A (and that constrained/orthogonal variants were tested).
* Scale the y-axis of dα/dz to a robust range (clip extreme spikes; annotate that extremes are from finite-difference noise at sparse z).

---

## — Holdout validation (adversarial set) (`fig09_holdout_validation.png`)

**What works**

* Great dashboard; communicates the story.

**Critical text to add**

* Caption must state **which set is which** and the metric values:

  * Training (N=4,960): RMS = 3.42 mag, mean ≈ 40.02 mag, MAD ≈ 2.43 mag.
  * Holdout (N=508): RMS = 8.16 mag, mean ≈ 34.89 mag, MAD ≈ 6.39 mag.
  * ΔRMS = +4.75 mag. 
* Add a small subtitle under the main title: “Holdout = SNe excluded by Stage-1 screen (χ² > 2000).”
* In the χ² histogram, label the red dashed line “training χ² cutoff”.
* Keep the “FAIL” badge, but clarify: “FAIL relative to a strict 0.05 mag goal; expected for adversarial set.”

---


**What works**

* Shows why the A/B/C test was necessary.

**Tweak**

* Right panel text: shorten to 2–3 bullet points; move long prose into the caption.
* Add explicit κ(ΦᵀΦ) value in the caption and mention that orthogonalization worsened WAIC (link forward to Results).

#Perfect—here’s the ordered figure plan starting **after your new Figure 1**. I’ve mapped each number to the exact file you already produced, wrote Google-Docs-ready captions, and noted where each should be cited in the paper.

**Figure 2 — Posterior corner plot (k_J, η′, ξ)**
File: `/mnt/data/fig1_corner_plot.png`
Caption: “Corner plot of the joint and marginal posteriors for k_J, η′, and ξ (68% contours). Convergence badges: R̂ ≈ 1.00, bulk ESS > 10,000, 0 divergences.”
Place: end of **§6.1 Posterior summary and convergence** (first figure in Results).

**Figure 3 — MCMC trace plots (four chains)**
File: `/mnt/data/fig2_mcmc_traces.png`
Caption: “Trace plots for k_J, η′, ξ, σ_α, ν across four chains showing stationary mixing and no pathologies.”
Place: immediately after Fig. 2; still in **§6.1**.

**Figure 4 — Hubble diagram and residuals (QFD vs ΛCDM)**
File: `/mnt/data/fig3_hubble_diagram.png`
Caption: “Hubble diagram μ versus z with QFD curve (solid blue) and baseline ΛCDM curve (dashed red) under identical likelihood and mapping. Bottom panel: residuals with running median; RMS ≈ 1.888 mag.”
Place: start of **§6.2 Hubble diagram fit**.

**Figure 5 — Residual diagnostics panel**
File: `/mnt/data/fig4_residual_diagnostics.png`
Caption: “(a) Residual histogram with mean and ±RMS, (b) normal Q–Q plot showing heavy tails, (c) residuals versus redshift with running median.”
Place: **§6.3 Residual diagnostics**.

**Figure 6 — Basis functions, derivatives, and collinearity**
File: `/mnt/data/fig02_basis_and_correlation.png`
Caption: “(a) Basis functions φ₁ = ln(1+z), φ₂ = z, φ₃ = z/(1+z); (b) finite-difference derivatives; (c) correlation matrix (|ρ| ≳ 0.97); (d) identifiability notes and condition number.”
Place: end of **§5 A/B/C model comparison (identifiability study)** to motivate the experiment.

**Figure 7 — Model internal behavior: α(z) and dα/dz**
File: `/mnt/data/fig07_alpha_vs_z.png`
Caption: “(a) Predicted α(z) with ±0.5 mag band; (b) finite-difference derivative dα/dz illustrating non-linear evolution with z.”
Place: close of **§6.2** (as an internal-consistency check following the Hubble plot).

**Figure 8 — Holdout validation (adversarial subset)**
File: `/mnt/data/fig09_holdout_validation.png`
Caption: “External validity on the adversarial holdout set (objects failing Stage-1). Panels: residuals vs z (train vs holdout), normalized residual distributions, Q–Q plot, χ² distribution, |residual| vs χ², and summary table. Holdout RMS ≈ 8.16 mag vs training ≈ 3.42 mag.”
Place: **§7 Holdout analysis** (main text). If you prefer to keep the core narrative lighter, label this **Figure S1** in the Supplement instead.

### Notes

* Keep your new **Figure 1** (time-dilation vs Planck/Wien broadening) in **§1 Introduction** to set the conceptual frame.
* The order above mirrors the flow: inference → fit → diagnostics → identifiability → internal physics → external validity.
* If you later add an A/B/C WAIC summary table/plot, insert it as **Figure 6 (new)** and bump the rest down by one; place it at the end of **§5**.

This numbering matches the current manuscript structure and the files you’ve generated; it’s ready to paste into Google Docs.
