## 📘 Overview

**Quantum Field Dynamics (QFD)** presents a radical yet rigorous unification of fundamental physics using a single real multivector field \( \psi(X, \tau) \) in 6D phase space, valued in Clifford Algebra \( Cl(3,3) \). From this unified structure, the theory derives:

- Emergent time (\( \tau \)) as scalar ordering, not a spacetime axis
- Gravity as field-induced time dilation
- Redshift as cumulative energy loss via photon-photon interactions
- Charge as a topological winding number
- Spin and g-factor from rotor dynamics
- Constants \( G, \hbar, c, e \) from a global calibration procedure

All physical laws—including Maxwell’s equations, the Dirac equation, and weak-field GR—emerge from the QFD master equation without postulates.

## 📐 Mathematical Consistency

✅ Single Lagrangian \( \mathcal{L}_{6D} \) in Cl(3,3)  
✅ Euler–Lagrange and Hamiltonian formalisms derived from first principles  
✅ All known fields arise from grade projections of \( \psi \)  
✅ Time emerges from geometric dynamics (not assumed)  
✅ Geometric Algebra replaces complex Hilbert space

## 🔬 Empirical Predictions

QFD is falsifiable and makes nontrivial, testable predictions:

| Observable             | QFD Prediction                             |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Redshift               | Flux-dependent photon scattering           |
| g−2                    | Geometric correction from wavelet shape    |
| CMB                    | Thermal equilibrium in static cosmos       |
| BAO                    | ψ-statistical feedback, not relic plasma   |
| Nuclear Binding        | From electron-nucleus field cancellation   |
| Weak Decay             | Temporal tunneling, no W/Z bosons          |
| Neutrino Oscillations  | Rotor-phase dephasing of ψ wavelets        |

## 🧠 Scientific Merit

- ✅ All 25 “Aha Moments” are formally derived
- ✅ Constants emerge from calibration, not tuning
- ✅ No need for Big Bang, inflation, or exotic forces
- ✅ Internal mathematical closure: nothing added by hand

This is not a reinterpretation of current models. It is a self-contained physical framework with its own derivation logic and internal engine.
