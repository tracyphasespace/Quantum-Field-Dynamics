## Overview

In QFD, photon physics emerges from **three fundamental constants** that characterize the vacuum medium:

1. **α ≈ 1/137.036** - Coupling strength (gear mesh precision)
2. **β ≈ 3.058** - Vacuum stiffness (sound speed, dispersion suppression)
3. **λ ~ 1 AMU** - Saturation scale (nonlinear self-focusing)

These are NOT independent empirical fits. They are **material properties** of the ψ-vacuum that together determine all electromagnetic phenomena.

## 1. Fine Structure Constant (α)

### 1.1 Definition

**Standard QED**:
```
α = e² / (4πε₀ℏc) ≈ 1/137.035999084
```

**Physical meaning**: Strength of electromagnetic interaction.

### 1.2 QFD Interpretation

**Role**: Gear mesh precision between electromagnetic field and vacuum.

**Nuclear sector formula**:
```
α⁻¹ = π² · exp(β) · (c₂/c₁)
     = 9.8696 · 21.280 · 6.42
     ≈ 134.7
```

**Current discrepancy**: ~1.7% from measured α⁻¹ = 137.036

**Challenge**: Derive c₂/c₁ = 6.42 from Cl(3,3) geometry (currently empirical).

### 1.3 Physical Effects

**What α determines**:

1. **Coupling efficiency**: How strongly photon couples to electron vortex
   - α ~ 1: Strong coupling → photon drags vacuum → effective mass
   - α ~ 10⁻⁶: Weak coupling → phase incoherence
   - α ~ 1/137: **Goldilocks** - tight lock, negligible drag

2. **Quantization grain size**: Precision of energy quanta
   - ℏω discretization comes from α-tuned coupling
   - All photons of frequency f are **identical bosons**

3. **Absorption cross-section**: Geometric lock-and-key size
   - σ_abs ∝ α (larger α → stronger absorption)

4. **Running coupling**: α increases with energy
   - α(m_e) = 1/137.036 (low energy)
   - α(m_Z) ≈ 1/128 (electroweak scale)
   - QFD interpretation: Vacuum permittivity ε(E) varies with energy

### 1.4 Measurements

**CODATA 2018 recommended value**:
```
α = 7.2973525693(11) × 10⁻³
α⁻¹ = 137.035999084(21)
```

**Relative uncertainty**: 1.5 × 10⁻¹⁰ (extremely precise!)

**Measurement methods**:
- Electron g-2 (most precise)
- Quantum Hall effect
- Hydrogen spectroscopy
- Positronium decay

**QFD requirement**: All sectors must predict same α from β.

## 2. Vacuum Stiffness (β)

### 2.1 Definition

**QFD**: Dimensionless parameter characterizing resistance to vacuum compression.

**Value**: β ≈ 3.058 (from nuclear binding energy fits and fine structure constant)

**Relation to π**: β ≈ 0.973 π (intriguing, but not exactly π)

### 2.2 Physical Meaning

**Elastic medium analogy**:
```
Energy_strain = ∫ (β/2) (∇ρ/ρ)² ρ dV
```

Where:
- ρ = vacuum density field
- ∇ρ = density gradient
- β = stiffness (resistance to compression)

**Higher β** → stiffer vacuum → harder to deform → faster sound speed.

### 2.3 Physical Effects

**What β determines**:

1. **Speed of light** (c_vac):
   ```
   c = √(β / ρ_vac) × (geometric factors)
   ```
   - β sets shear wave speed in vacuum superfluid
   - c is NOT fundamental - it's **derived** from β and vacuum density

2. **Dispersion suppression**:
   - High β → sharp sound cone → uniform speed across wavelengths
   - ω(k) ≈ c|k| (linear, no dispersion)
   - Without β-stiffness: photons would blur over cosmic distances

3. **Lensing without curvature**:
   - Light bends near stars because vacuum density h(ψ_s) increases
   - Speed drops: c' = c_vac / √h
   - No spacetime curvature needed!

4. **Nuclear binding**:
   - Same β appears in nuclear saturation density
   - Connects photon sector to nuclear sector
   - **Universality test**: Same β must work in both!

### 2.4 Measurements

**From nuclear binding energy** (saturation):
```
β ≈ 3.1 ± 0.05  (from binding energy per nucleon plateau)
```

**From fine structure constant**:
```
β = ln(α⁻¹ / (π² · (c₂/c₁)))
  = ln(137.036 / (9.8696 · 6.42))
  ≈ 3.058
```

**Consistency**: Nuclear and photon sectors agree to ~2%!

**Challenge**: Reduce uncertainty by deriving c₂/c₁ from geometry.

### 2.5 Comparison to Other "Stiffnesses"

| Medium | Stiffness | Sound Speed | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Air | K ~ 10⁵ Pa | 343 m/s | Compressible gas |
| Water | K ~ 2.2 GPa | 1480 m/s | Incompressible liquid |
| Steel | K ~ 160 GPa | 5000 m/s | Rigid solid |
| **ψ-Vacuum** | **β ≈ 3.058** | **c = 3×10⁸ m/s** | **Ultra-stiff superfluid** |

**ψ-vacuum is 10⁹× stiffer than steel** (in appropriate units).

## 3. Saturation Scale (λ)

### 3.1 Definition

**QFD**: Energy/length scale where nonlinear vacuum effects become significant.

**Value**: λ ~ 1 AMU (atomic mass unit) ~ proton mass scale

**Related scales**:
- Proton mass: m_p ≈ 938.3 MeV/c² ≈ 1.67 × 10⁻²⁷ kg
- Proton Compton wavelength: λ_p = ℏ/(m_p c) ≈ 1.32 fm
- Nuclear size scale: r_nucleus ~ 1-10 fm

### 3.2 Physical Meaning

**Saturation**: Energy density where vacuum ψ-field becomes strongly nonlinear.

**Linear regime** (E << λ):
- Vacuum responds linearly to perturbations
- Maxwell equations are exact
- No self-interaction

**Nonlinear regime** (E ~ λ):
- Vacuum self-interaction becomes significant
- Modified Maxwell equations (variable metric h(ψ_s))
- Soliton formation (self-trapping)

**Beyond saturation** (E >> λ):
- Vacuum "saturates" - can't compress further
- Nuclear density regime
- Soliton cores (protons, neutrons)

### 3.3 Physical Effects

**What λ determines**:

1. **Photon self-focusing**:
   - Intense light slightly deforms vacuum
   - Creates traveling "potential well"
   - Packet pinches inward → counters dispersion

   **Soliton balance**:
   ```
   Dispersion (∝ 1/β) = Nonlinear focusing (∝ 1/λ²)
   ```

2. **Photon-photon scattering**:
   - Nonlinear vacuum → direct γγ interaction
   - Beyond QED box diagrams (virtual fermions)
   - Cross-section ∝ (E/λ)⁶ at low energy

3. **Nuclear binding scale**:
   - Same λ sets nuclear saturation density
   - Proton/neutron solitons have size ~ λ_p
   - Universality: photon λ = nuclear λ

4. **Vacuum breakdown threshold**:
   - Schwinger limit: E_crit ~ m_e² c³ / (eℏ) ~ 10¹⁸ V/m
   - Related to λ via pair production threshold
   - QFD: Vacuum "rips" when field exceeds λ-scale

### 3.4 Measurements

**From proton mass**:
```
λ = m_p c² ≈ 938.3 MeV
```

**From nuclear saturation density**:
```
ρ_sat ≈ 0.16 nucleons/fm³
→ λ ~ (ρ_sat)^(-1/3) ~ 1.8 fm
```

**From photon-photon scattering limits**:
```
σ(γγ → γγ) < experimental_limit
→ λ > threshold (constrained by laser experiments)
```

**Consistency check**: All three λ measurements should agree.

### 3.5 Why Proton Mass Scale?

**QFD hypothesis**: λ is NOT independent - it's **determined by** α and β.

**Possible relation**:
```
λ ~ ℏc / (α β × geometric_factor)
```

**Challenge**: Derive this relationship from ψ-field Lagrangian.

## 4. The Three-Constant Interplay

### 4.1 Division of Labor

Each constant has a specific role in photon stability:

| Constant | Role | Physical Effect | Photon Property |
|----------|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **β** | Vacuum stiffness | Uniform propagation speed | No bulk dispersion |
| **λ** | Saturation scale | Nonlinear self-focusing | No spreading |
| **α** | Coupling strength | Quantization normalization | Identical bosons |

**Together**: Create self-guiding wavepacket stable over Gpc distances.

### 4.2 Soliton Stability Condition

For photon to be stable soliton:

1. **Dispersion suppression** (from β):
   ```
   ω(k) ≈ c|k| + O((k/k_β)²)
   where k_β ~ β × (geometric factor)
   ```

2. **Nonlinear focusing** (from λ):
   ```
   ∂ρ_vac/∂E ~ 1/λ² (self-trapping strength)
   ```

3. **Quantization** (from α):
   ```
   E = n·ℏω (discrete, identical packets)
   ```

**Balance point**: Packet width L stabilizes where:
```
dL/dt = (Dispersion - Focusing) = 0
→ L_stable ~ √(β/λ) × (geometric factors)
```

### 4.3 Parameter Space

**Allowed region** (for stable photons):

```
α ~ 10⁻² to 10⁻³  (weak coupling, no mass)
β > 1             (stiff enough to suppress dispersion)
λ ~ GeV scale     (nonlinear focusing at nuclear scale)
```

**Our universe**:
```
α = 1/137.036     ✓ (in allowed range)
β = 3.058         ✓ (sufficiently stiff)
λ ~ 1 GeV         ✓ (proton mass scale)
```

**What if different?**

| Scenario | α | β | λ | Result |
|----------|---|---|---|--------|
| Stronger EM | 1/10 | 3 | 1 GeV | Photons have mass, light slow |
| Weak EM | 1/1000 | 3 | 1 GeV | Poor quantization, fuzzy photons |
| Soft vacuum | 1/137 | 0.1 | 1 GeV | High dispersion, light blurs |
| Stiff vacuum | 1/137 | 100 | 1 GeV | Ultra-sharp, but c changes |
| Light saturation | 1/137 | 3 | 1 keV | Photon-photon scattering at optical energies |
| Heavy saturation | 1/137 | 3 | 1 TeV | No nonlinear focusing, packets spread |

**Fine-tuning?** Or are α, β, λ related by deeper principle?

## 5. Cross-Sector Consistency

### 5.1 Nuclear Sector

**Same constants** appear in nuclear binding:

- **β**: Saturation density, binding energy per nucleon
- **λ**: Proton/neutron soliton size
- **α**: Coulomb term in SEMF

**Test**: Predict nuclear masses from photon-sector β, λ, α.

**Current status**: β agreement within ~2%, λ exact (by construction).

### 5.2 Lepton Sector

**Photon birth**: Emitted by electron vortex transitions

- Electron vortex has Compton radius ~ ℏ/(m_e c)
- Photon inherits quantization ℏ from electron
- α determines coupling strength

**Test**: Electron g-2 from vacuum corrections (α, β, λ).

### 5.3 Cosmology Sector

**CMB photons**: Last scattering at z ≈ 1100

- Travel ~13 Gyr without dispersion (tests β-stiffness)
- Sharp spectral lines (tests λ-focusing)
- Polarization patterns (tests α-coupling)

**Test**: CMB power spectrum from ψ-vacuum properties.
