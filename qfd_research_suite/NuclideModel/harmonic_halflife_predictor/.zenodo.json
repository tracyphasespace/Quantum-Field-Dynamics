  "title": "Harmonic Half-Life Predictor: Nuclear Decay Prediction from Geometric Quantization",
  "description": "A nuclear decay half-life prediction framework based on geometric quantization and harmonic resonance. This archive contains complete code, data, results, and documentation for predicting half-lives of 3,530 nuclei using a 3-family harmonic resonance model. Key features: (1) Universal selection rule |ΔN| ≤ 1 for allowed transitions, (2) 99.7% accuracy for beta- decay direction, (3) Complete transparency with PROCESS_AND_METHODS.md for scientific verification, (4) Nuclear spectroscopy framework with yrast diagrams, (5) Validated against 47 experimental isotopes.",
