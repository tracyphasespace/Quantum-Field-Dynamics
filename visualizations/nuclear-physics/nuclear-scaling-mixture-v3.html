<h2>Generalization from the Cleanest 2,400 to the Remaining 3,442</h2>
<p>
To assess generalization, we ranked all nuclides by absolute residual under the full-data 3-line (A-only) model,
selected the best <b>2,400</b> points for training, fit the three lines only on that subset, and then predicted
for the remaining <b>3,442</b> holdout nuclides using the nearest-line assignment.
</p>
<table>
<tr><th>Split</th><th>Count</th><th>RMSE</th><th>R²</th></tr>
<tr><td>Train (best 2,400)</td><td>2400</td><td>0.5225</td><td>0.999678</td></tr>
<tr><td>Holdout (remaining 3,442)</td><td>3442</td><td>1.8069</td><td>0.994673</td></tr>
<tr><td>Overall</td><td>5842</td><td>1.4268</td><td>0.997129</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The model trained on a clean subset remains highly predictive on the larger set (R²≈0.9947), with higher
residuals on holdout as expected since the tails were not used for fitting. The overall performance (R²≈0.9971)
matches the full-data fit closely.
